\v 5
\vt All da peopo from Judea side an Jerusalem town, dey wen go da
boonies fo hear John. Dey wen tell um strait out all da bad kine
stuff dey wen do, an he wen baptize um inside da Jordan River.
\ntHint Greek 'pantes': not necessarily every last person, but lots, by
a hyperbole common in Greek. Could be "plenny plenny," but "all"
is OK.

\vt You know, John's clotheses come from da camel hair. He wen make

\vt Had wild animals ova dea. Jesus, he wen stay dea forty days. Da
Devil try presha him fo make him do bad kine stuff, but he neva.
An had angel messenja guys from God dat wen come an take care
him.
\ntHint Satanaa: da Devil "Wild animals" is part of the setting for Pidgin,
so moved to connect with "boonies". Implicit "come" to get them
on site. Not "take care Jesus," because the reference is clear
from the cast of characters and the semantics. In this case the
pronoun works.

\s Jesus Make One Bad Kine Spirit Let Go One Guy
\r (Luke 4:31-37)
\p 
\v 21
\vt Jesus an his guys, dey wen go Capernaum town. On da Jewish Rest
Day,|fn
\ft 1:21: Jewish peopo worshipping day, rest day, or day of stopping
work, they call 'Sabat Day'.
\btft 1:21:
\vt dey go inside da Jewish church. Jesus start fo teach da peopo.
\v 22
\vt Wat he teach um wen blow dea minds! Cuz he teach wit plenny power,
not like da teacha guys dat teach God's Rules, an dem guys no
mo power.
\cf 1:22: Matthew 7:28-29
\p 
\v 23
\vt Get one guy inside da Jewish church wit one bad spirit dat wen
take ova him. Right den an dea he wen yell,
\ntHint "take ova" and "let go" is the culturally appropriate way to talk
about a person being under the control of an outside power. "In"
and "go out" or "throw out" doesn't make a lot of sense.
\v 24
\vt <<Ho! You Jesus from Nazaret! Wat you like do to us? Why you wen
come ova hea? Fo wipe us out? I know who you! You da Good an Spesho
Guy from God!>>
\p 
\v 25
\vt Jesus wen scold da spirit, <<Shut yoa mout! Let go da guy!>>
\v 26
\vt Den da bad spirit wen shake up da guy plenny. Da spirit wen yell
real loud, an let go da guy.
\p

\vt Da peopo, wen blow dea minds. Dey tell each odda, <<Eh! Wass dis?!
Wat kine new teaching dis? Dis guy, he get power! He even tell
da bad kine spirits wat fo do, an dey do um!>>
\ntHint Several people have remarked on the inadequacy of just "?" and
"!" for Pidgin. The combination "?!" is what they suggest for
something that sounds like a question but which is really a surprised
exclamation. kat' exousian: could go either with "teaching" or
with "tell". This kind of sits on the fence.
\v 28
\vt Right den an dea, da peopo wen go all ova Galilee side, fo tell
everybody bout Jesus.

\s Jesus Make One Lepa Guy Come Good

\p

\vt Had one lepa guy wen go by Jesus, an go down in front him an beg
him. He say, <<If you like, you can make me come good so I can
go wit da odda peopo fo pray, yeah?>>
\ntHint lepros: probably not a Hansen's disease patient, but someone suffering
from a skin disease that made him ritually unfit for worship.
But with so many people here having relatives who were (or are)
in the Kalaupapa leper colony, "lepa" has instant recognition,
and a strong emotional reaction as serious. Ideas of "ritually
impure" are not, on the other hand, common in the culture. katharisai:
"cleanse" in the ritual sense, "make me so I can worship with
the rest again"
\p 
\v 41
\vt Jesus wen look at him, an he pity him. He touch da guy, an say,
<<Okay, I do um. Come good.>>
\v 42
\vt Right den an dea da lepa guy come good. No mo lepa!
\ntHint "Lepa" in glossary.
\p 
\v 43-44
\vt Jesus wen talk strong to da guy. He tell um, <<Eh! You betta not
tell nobody bout dis! Go, let da priest guy check you out. No
foget make da kine sacrifice now, jalike Moses wen tell inside
God's Rules. Den everybody goin know dat you stay good now.>>
Den he tell um fo go.
\ntHint -44: embrimeesamenos ... exebalen: Jesus was very abrupt with
the man, and practically pushed him out the door. Two senses of
"now": admonition with "no foget", and time with "stay good."
No clash.
\v 45
\vt But da guy, he go outside an tell everybody wat wen happen to
him. So, Jesus no can stay inside da towns, but he gotta stay
outside inside da boonies. An da peopo, dey stay come from all
ova da place fo hear him.

\vt Some guys wen come by Jesus. Four a dem wen carry one guy dat

\v 4
\vt Get so plenny peopo, dey no can bring him near Jesus. So dey wen
go up on top da flat roof, an make one big puka inside da roof,
right ova da place wea Jesus stay. Dey put da guy on top his mat
an put um down real slow in front Jesus.
\ntHint krabatton: The mat was the sick man's, not a mat that happened
to be in front of Jesus.
\v 5
\vt Wen Jesus see dat, he wen tink, <<Eh, wow! Dis guys trus me fo
real kine, dat I goin make dea friend come good!>> Den he tell
da guy, <<Eh, my boy, you know all da bad kine stuff you wen do
befo? I tell you now, da shame from all dat, pau awready!>>
\p

\vt But get some teacha guys dea dat teach God's Rules. Dey stay tinking,

God! Ony God can let da guy go an hemo da shame from da bad kine

come you guys tinking bad kine stuff lidat?
\ntHint pneumati: could say "inside his spirit", but it isn't as meaningful
as "inside". Same thing for "inside yoa heart".

\vt I Da Guy Dass Fo Real, an I like show proof you guys, dat I get
da right inside dis world, fo let da peopo go an hemo da shame

fo do um. But now, I goin show proof you guys -- I goin make dis
sick guy make strong.>>
\p

\v 11
\vt <<Eh, get up! Take yoa mat an go home awready!>>
\p 
\v 12

Levi stay by da tax place collecting money fo da govermen. Jesus
tell him, <<Eh! Come wit me! Be my guy!>> Levi get up, an go wit
him.
\ntHint ... Levi stand up, ...
\p 
\v 15
\vt Jesus wen go Levi's house fo eat. Had plenny guys dat collect
money fo tax fo da govermen an odda guys dat get bad name jalike
dem, dat like hang out wit Jesus. Dey all dea, eating wit Jesus
an his guys.
\ntHint Check with basilectal speakers. teloonai kai hamartooloi: sinners
in the eyes of the pharisaical. Even in Galilee of the Gentiles,
people who associated with non-Jews were considered second class
Jews. It isn't a matter of them actually sinning or being bad
people; they were just religious outcasts as the religious leaders
defined it. Verse 16 mentions them too, and 17 mentions the outcasts.eekolouthoun:
they were tagging along (not "plenny peopo" but a crowd of the
wrong kind of people who were curious about Jesus and wanted to
see more).
\p 
\v 16
\vt Had some Pharisee guys dea dat teach God's Rules. Dey see Jesus
dea eating wit all da tax guys an odda kine peopo dat get bad
name jalike dem. So, dey aks Jesus guys, <<Eh, yoa teacha, how
come he eating wit da tax guys an odda kine peopo dat get bad
name?>>
\ov ... odda kine peopo dat get bad name jalike dem. ... (twice)
\ntHint "odda kine peopo jalike dem" in Matthew. "Bad name jalike dem"
may be better, since it is judgmental and reflects the Pharisees'
viewpoint. It also leads into Verse 17 better, which the neutral
term used in Matthew doesn't do. Matthew has "fo da odda kine
peopo" in 9:13. Change?
\p 
\v 17
\vt Jesus wen hear dat, an he tell dem, <<Da peopo dat not sick, dey
no need docta, ony da sick guys need. Me, I neva come fo tell
da good kine peopo fo come by me fo be my guys, but da peopo dat
get bad name.>>

David wen do wen him an his guys was hungry?
\v 26
\vt Wen Abiatar was da Head Priest, David go inside God's house an
eat da bread dass spesho fo God. But no can do dat kine, cuz God's
Rules say dat ony da priest guys can eat dat bread. But David,
he give um to his guys too, an nobody say notting.>>
\ntHint The point is not just that David and his ate the special bread,
but that the action is not condemned by Scripture even though
it broke the letter of the law.
\p 
\v 27
\vt Den Jesus wen tell, <<You know, God neva make da peopo fo da Rest
Day. He make da Rest Day fo da peopo.
\v 28
\vt Dass why I da One dat get da right fo say wat can do da Rest Day,
cuz I Da Guy Dass Fo Real.>>
\ntgk ho hyios tou anthroopou: Jesus is talking about himself. Is this
clear? "Lord" is a relation to people, not to a time period. The
relation to the day has to be spelled out more, because "Boss"
does not collocate that way.
