<p>The <i>Restore From Backup Dialog</i> is used to restore the translation of 
  a book to a previous version. The Auto-Backup command must have been enabled 
  (see the <a href="AutoBackup/AutoBackup.html">Automatically 
  Backing Up Data</a> topic.) The dialog is accessed from the Tools dropdown, 
  provided that the feature has been turned on via the <a href="SetupFeatures.html">Setup 
  Features</a> dialog.</p>

<p>The dialog shows the name of the book (and its current filename) that will 
  be restored. This it the book which is currently being edited; and thus the 
  one that will be replaced.</p>
<p>To restore to an older version,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the <i>Browse</i> button. This will bring up a list of the previously 
    backed-up files that are available for the restore operation. Chose one from 
    this list and click on <font size="-1">OK</font>. (The file will appear in 
    the white area of the dialog.)</li>
  <li>Click on the <i>Restore</i> button.</li>
  <li>You will be presented with an &quot;<i>Are You Sure?</i>&quot; dialog, to 
    make certain that you really want to proceed. Keep in mind that a restore 
    operation will permanently erase your current work, replacing it with what 
    is in your backup file. Therefore press &quot;<i>Yes</i>&quot; only if you 
    are sure you want to proceed with the restore.</li>
</ul>
