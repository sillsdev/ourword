<p>Translation Notes are notes that the translator or advisor makes during the 
  translation process. </p>
<p>Beginning with Version 1.1, OurWord has changed from its former model of supporting 
  some twelve different types of static notes, to a conversational model of notes. 
  In this conversational model, a note is more of a chat session between the various 
  people on a translation team.</p>

<h3>Notes about the Implementation</h3>
<h3>1. File Storage</h3>
<p>Translation Notes are stored in an xml format, regardless of whether the containing 
  file is xml or standard format. Within a standard format file, a &quot;\tn&quot; 
  marker indicates a translator note, and will appear along the lines of:</p>
<p>\tn &lt;TranslatorNote Category=&quot;To Do&quot; Assigned=&quot;John&quot; 
  Context=&quot;so loved the world&quot; Ref=&quot;003:016&quot;&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Disc Author=&quot;John&quot; Created=&quot;2008-11-01 
  00:00:00Z&quot; Text=&quot;Check exegesis here.&quot;/&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Disc Author=&quot;Sandra&quot; Created=&quot;2008-11-03 
  00:00:00Z&quot; Text=&quot;Exegesis is fine.&quot;/&gt;<br>
  &lt;/TranslatorNote&gt;</p>
<p>You should never edit the contents of a note by hand, as you could cause <i>OurWord</i> 
  to then fail to parse them. Always edit notes from within the OurWord editor.</p>
<h3>2. Conversion of Old-Format Notes</h3>
<p>The old notes consisted of a unique marker (e.g., \ov was an Old Version note; 
  \ntDef was a Definition note) followed by the note text. On reading files with 
  the old notes, <i>OurWord</i> now converts them to the new style, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The type (Old Version, Definition, etc.) is placed into the Category field</li>
  <li>The contents are placed into a Discussion paragraph. That paragraph is given 
    the date the file was imported, and the author is &quot;Old Note.&quot;</li>
  <li>Assigned To is set to &quot;closed,&quot; indicating that now further action 
    is expected.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Hints for Drafting</i> Notes</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>While it is true that the Front Translation contains a huge amount of information 
    that can be used in creating the daughters, it is often desired to supplement 
    the Front with additional notes that the translator might need. Such notes 
    might include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>areas that have been known to be stumbling blocks to translators in the 
      past,</li>
    <li>additional information that provides background or implicit information 
      that the daughter translator needs. </li>
    <li>the reasoning behind exegetical decisions, or perhaps, an alternative 
      that is supportable in the original languages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Creating Hints for Drafting Notes. </b><i>OurWord</i> uses a <code>\ntHint</code> 
    field in the Standard Format files it stores to represent these<i> Hint for 
    Drafting</i> notes. If you desire to expand the Front translation with these 
    hints, then you will need to place <code>\ntHint</code> fields within the 
    Front. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In most situations, you will need to directly edit the Standard Format 
      file via Shoebox/Toolbox or Paratext.</li>
    <li>If you are using a daughter (that is based on one Front) as the Front 
      for another language, then you can insert <i>Hints for Drafting</i> notes 
      within <i>OurWord</i>. Use the <i>Configuration</i> dialog to turn on these 
      notes, as you would any other type of note that the program supports. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Displaying Hints for Drafting Notes. </b>To display these notes when drafting, 
    turn them on in the Notes section of the Configuration dialog.</p>
  <p><b>Miscellaneous. </b><i>OurWord</i> attempts to match up notes from Front 
    paragraphs to the Target paragraph; where the structures differ, the software 
    may not always get it correct. I recommend that you always include the verse 
    reference at the beginning of the note, and even better, the phrase that is 
    being expounded upon, so make it easier for the translator to connect the 
    note with the correct place in the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><i>Exegetical</i> Notes</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>OurWord</i> offers a mechanism by which exegetical notes defined in the 
    Front translation are automatically propagated to the daughter translation, 
    and thus visible when working on the back translation, or when doing a printout 
    for the consultant.</p>
  <p>The notes are not edited within <i>OurWord</i>, rather, they must be inserted 
    into the Front via Toolbox or other standard format editor. But as long as 
    a section's structure is identical with that of the front, the note will be 
    propagated to the daughter each time the daughter is read into <i>OurWord</i>. 
  </p>
  <p>There are three types of exegetical notes:</p>
  <table width="100%" border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td width="19%">Standard Format Marker</td>
      <td width="81%">Note</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td width="19%"><b>\ntgk</b></td>
      <td width="81%">Greek exegesis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td width="19%"><b>\nthb</b></td>
      <td width="81%">Hebrew exegesis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td width="19%"><b>\ntcn</b></td>
      <td width="81%">General note for justification of the exegesis or structure</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>In the Configuration Dialog, there is a checkbox to turn these notes on or 
    off.</p>
