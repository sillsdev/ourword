<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Localization is the process of translating the user interface from English 
  into another language. <i>OurWord</i> allows two such translations to be active 
  so that, e.g., you can set it up to first try to display a given element (such 
  as a menu item) in the local language; and if unsuccessful, to then attempt 
  in a national language; and if still unsuccessful, resort to English. <i>OurWord</i> 
  provides a Localizer Tool through which you can easily translate the various 
  user interface elements</p>
<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Localization is the process of translating the user interface into another 
  language. <i>OurWord</i> was designed to make localization as easy as possible. 
  Although software is normally presented to users with English user interfaces, 
  it is our obvservation that translators prefer an interface that is in a language 
  that is more familiar to them. Our goal with <i>OurWord</i> has been to make 
  it easy not only to translate the user interface into a national language or 
  a language of wider communication; but to be able to easily go even further 
  and translate it into the mother tongue.</p>
<p>To that end, <i>OurWord</i> provides a Localizer Tool, accessed from the Tools 
  menu. (You turn on access to it through the <a href="SetupFeatures.html">Setup 
  Features Dialog</a>.) Within the Localizer Tool, you first tell it that you 
  want to localize to a new language, and then for each element in the user interface 
  you supply its translation.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Translator vs Advisor</h3>
<p><i>OurWord</i> makes a distinction between <b>Translator</b> versus <b>Advisor</b> 
  tasks. The Advisor typically handles the various setup and configuration tasks. 
  The Advisor interface is mostly contained in the Configuration Dialog, and is 
  typically not seen by most translators. If you are working in a situation where 
  the translator will not be doing any of the <i>OurWord</i> configuration, then 
  you can elect to not localize those parts of the user interface. </p>
<p>The <i>Localizer Tool</i> distinguishes between those elements which must be 
  localized for the Translator verses which ones are only for the Advisor. In 
  a Combo Box you can choose between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show All</li>
  <li>Translator Items</li>
  <li>Advisor Items</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Preferred (Primary) and Fallback (Secondary) Languages</h3>
<p>At runtime <i>OurWord</i> works with three languages. </p>
<ol>
  <li>It first attempts to display a given element (such as a menu name) in the 
    Preferred (Primary) Language.</li>
  <li>If it cannot find a translation in the Preferred Language, then it attempts 
    to use the Fallback (Secondary) Language. </li>
  <li>If there is no translation in the Fallback Language, then <i>OurWord</i> 
    displays English.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Preferred and Fallback languages are specified in the Project-Properties 
  dialog, under the Options section. </p>
<p>This means that you can do a partial localization. E.g., you might have a thorough 
  localization of most of <i>OurWord</i> in a national language such as Indonesian, 
  and you would set this as your Fallback Language. Then you might just localize 
  the menus into the receptor language, and set that as the Preferred Language. 
  The result is that the most important parts of the user interface would be available 
  to the translator in his own language, and less-common things such as error 
  messages would be available in his national languages. And of course, less important 
  elements would still display in English.</p>
<p>Thus it is not a requirement to localize every single element in order to provide 
  a meaningful user experience to the translator.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Localizer Dialog</h3>
<p>The <i>Localizer Dialog </i>is invoked via the <i>Tools</i> menu. The default 
  installation of <i>OurWord</i> hides this dialog; you must turn it on through 
  the <i>Setup Features</i> dialog. </p>
<p>In this dialog, the tree view to the left contains all of the elements that 
  must be localized. The elements are organized into groups, e.g.,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Menus</li>
  <li>Toolbar Text</li>
  <li>Dialog: Print</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can choose which item you wish to work on by selecting that group in 
  the tree view, and then working on the elements within it.</p>
<p>When you select an element, the area to the right of the dialog shows information 
  about it. There is</p>
<ul>
  <li>general information about the entire group (e.g., if you are working on 
    Menus, then you'll see general information about specific things you'll want 
    to be aware of as you design the menu system),</li>
  <li>information about the element you are translating (so that you can know 
    how it fits into the big picture,</li>
  <li>The item in English</li>
  <li>Any shortcut key or tooltip associated with the item, in English</li>
</ul>
<p>You then have a place to do your own translations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Of the item</li>
  <li>Of the associated tooltip</li>
  <li>Of the shortcut key</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To begin localization for a new language,</b> click on the <i>New</i> button. 
  You will be presented with a dialog in which you enter the name of the language 
  and optionally choose a font for displaying it. You can update this information 
  at any time by clicking on the <i>Properties</i> button.</p>
<p><b>The Treeview uses color coding</b> to indicate elements that still need 
  work. Items in dark blue have translations; items in red still need work. An 
  item will be in red if (1) it needs a translation, or (2) it does not match 
  up with the English in some other area, e.g., menu items need an ampersand (&amp;) 
  to indicate hot keys, some menu items need an ellipses (...) to indicate that 
  a dialog will be brought up. You can set the Filter (in the toolbar) to only 
  show those items that still need work.</p>
<hr>
<h3>File Storage</h3>
<p>The localization file is stored in the &quot;CommonApplicationData&quot; folder, 
  which is defined by the operating system. This is an area which can be accessed 
  by both administrative and limited users.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Windows Vista</i>: C:\ProgramData\OurWord\Loc\</li>
  <li><i>Windows XP</i>: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\OurWord\Loc</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that depending on your operating system, you may need to fiddle with 
  the settings in your Control Panel in order to be able to view these folders.)</p>
<p>These are all stored in a separate XML files. The main file is <i>OurWordLocalizations.xml</i>. 
  Other files are stored by their language ID's, e.g., </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>sp.xml</i> - Spanish</li>
  <li><i>inz.xml</i> - Indonesian</li>
</ul>
<p><i>OurWord</i> ships with a number of these files; but you can add your own 
  simply by placing it into the folder described above.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Eventual anticipated enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to merge files (so that it is possible to combine two different 
    peoples' work on, e.g., Spanish.)</li>
  <li>More conditions which trigger red text for when an item does not properly 
    match up with the English.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Submitting languages for the general <i>OurWord</i> release</h3>
<p>Where possible I would like to accumulate localizations for inclusions in future 
  releases. This makes your work available for other users. They might either 
  user it directly, or they might use it as a source for their own tweaks into 
  a related languages.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you are interested in submitting your localization. It 
  is a simple thing for me to include it. The main issue for you to consider is 
  how it might be updated in the future. Do you want to serve as the &quot;owner&quot;, 
  meaning that if others have suggestions for changes, that they would run them 
  by you for approval; or should we work out some other &quot;vetting&quot; person 
  or committee to handle these suggestions? </p>
<p>I also recognize that some languages are sensitive, and inclusion in a public 
  release of <i>OurWord</i> would not be appropriate. Be aware that <i>OurWord</i> 
  is &quot;open source,&quot; meaning that anyone in the world can download the 
  software, including its localizations. If you are working with a sensitive language, 
  you may prefer to pass your localizations to others through your own networking, 
  rather than through the public release.</p>
