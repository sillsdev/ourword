<p>The Locking feature instructs <i>OurWord</i> to present a book for display, 
  but to not permit editing. Users can add <i>To Do</i> notes, but can not make 
  any other types of changes.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why this feature might be used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A book has been published, and therefore no further changes are desired; 
    yet notes can be made in case a revision is ever done.</li>
  <li>A book has reached the stage where other people are involved who are working 
    on other computers, and it is desirable to prevent changes from being made 
    on more than one computer at the same time (thus avoiding a merge problem.)</li>
  <li>This helps guard the integrity of the process. Things cannot be changed 
    on a whim or personal preference, that have already been thoroughly processed 
    with the team advisor, a community check, or a consultant check. At this point 
    any suggested changes to the text now have to go through proper channels and 
    be evaluated against the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<p>A book is locked through a checkbox on the <i>Book Properties</i> dialog (which 
  is accessed from the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>.)</p>

<p>Once a book is locked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The book no longer is displayed with the white background (white is used 
    in <i>OurWord</i> to indicate text that can be edited.)</li>
  <li>If typing is attempted, a message is displayed to the user informing him 
    that editing is not permitted,</li>
  <li>Other visual indicators include red text in the navigation dropdowns and 
    the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, and a &quot;padlock&quot; icon in the view's 
    titlebar.</li>

  <li>The user can select text, and then create a <i>To Do</i> note for that text.</li>
</ul>
<p>To unlock a book, simply return to the <i>Book Properties </i>dialog and clear 
  the checkbox. </p>
