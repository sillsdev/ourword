<p>Most software programs restore the window to the screen coordinates of where 
  it was when it was previously shut down. If it was previously maximized, then 
  it is maximized when started again. If it was previously taking up a small part 
  of the screen, then when started again it continues to have that small size 
  and location.</p>
<p>In working with new computer users, however, we found that window manipulation 
  is one of the more difficult aspects of software to learn. Thus if a window's 
  size has, by mistake, been made too small; the user is often at a loss as how 
  to restore it to a more usable condition.</p>
<p>For this reason, <i>OurWord</i>'s default behavior is to always maximize on 
  startup. We figure that for most translators, they will want to work with a 
  maximized window, and thus we should support that behavior.</p>
<p>The advisor can go into the <i>Tools-Configure</i> dialog, under the <i>Options</i> 
  tab, and turn off this automatic &quot;maximize on startup&quot; setting. Having 
  done so, <i>OurWord</i> will then behave in the more normal fashion of starting 
  up in the same location and size as when last shut down.</p>
