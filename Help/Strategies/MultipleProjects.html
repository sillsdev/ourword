<p>In a cluster situation you will typically have multiple projects that you are 
  working with. Similarly if you are a consultant, you will likely be working 
  with multiple projects.</p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> remembers the most recent projects that you have worked with, 
  and places them at the bottom of the Project dropdown menu. Thus instead of 
  opening a project every time you want to look at it, simply look for it in the 
  Project dropdown. </p>
<p>Projects often benefit from sharing some of the same settings, and <i>OurWord</i> 
  facilitates this. The two most typically shared settings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple projects will often use the same source / front translation. In 
    the <i>New Project</i> <a href="../GettingStarted/CreatingANewProject.html">wizard</a>, 
    you can specify an existing front translation, rather than inventing a new 
    one for each project.</li>
  <li>Multiple projects will often use the same <i>Team Settings</i> (which includes 
    the stylesheet, writing systems, and other similar settings.) For any project, 
    you can specify which Team Settings to use through the <i>Team Settings</i> 
    tab on the <i>Tools-Configuration</i> dialog. </li>
</ul>
<p>When any of these shared settings are changed, the changes are reflected for 
  all projects that make use of them.</p>
