<p>Printing is accessed through the Print button. (If this button is not visible, 
  use the <a href="SetupFeatures.html">Setup Features Dialog</a> to turn it on.) 
  This command brings up a dialog, which allows you to set up the print job.</p>
<p>The dialog allows you to set up the folowing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Printer combo box contains all of the printers that are currently available 
    on your computer or network. Your default printer is shown, but you can use 
    the drop-down arrow to choose a different printer.</li>
  <li>The Range defines exactly what Scripture you will be printing: 
    <ul>
      <li> Entire Book will print the book that you currently have loaded<br>
      </li>
      <li> Current Section will just print the section that you are currently 
        displaying<br>
      </li>
      <li> Pages will print the range of pages that you define.</li>
      <li>Chapters will print the pages that contain the chapters you define</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Print Watermark will print a light-gray background on each page giving 
    the status of the book, e.g., &quot;Draft&quot; or &quot;Team Revision.&quot; 
    This can be helpful in reinforcing to a reader that the printout is not the 
    final version, and thus comments and changes are welcome.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Make Substitutions converts angle brackets into quotes.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Print Pictures, if unchecked, will save paper by omitting pictures in the 
    text.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Line Spacing permits you to choose between Single, 1.5 and Double. With 
    the larger line spacings, it is easier for a person to hand-write comments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced Print Options</h3>
<p>The <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, <i>Team Settings</i> section, allows you to 
  specify other print options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The composition of the footers on odd and even pages. For each footer, there 
    are three parts (left, middle and right), and these parts can be set to any 
    of the following options: 
    <ul>
      <li> Leave Blank<br>
      </li>
      <li> Page Number, which appears as, e.g., &quot;- 3 -&quot;<br>
      </li>
      <li> Book Stage and Date, which appears as, e.g., &quot;Draft - 6/1/2006&quot;<br>
      </li>
      <li> Language, Book Stage and Date, which appears as, e.g., &quot;Navajo 
        - Draft - 6/1/2006&quot;<br>
      </li>
      <li> Copyright Notice, which is the string you enter in the Copyright Notice 
        setting. This will be a team-wide notice. You can also define noticies 
        for individual books, by going to the Book Properties Dialog.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Scripture Reference, which appears as, e.g., &quot;John 3:16.&quot; 
        (This is the first verse number that appears on the page.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The contents of an optional copyright notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The font used for the footer is the &quot;Running Header&quot; style, which 
  you can change in the <a href="Stylesheet.html">StyleSheet</a>. This may especially 
  be desirable if you use a lengthy copyright notice.</p>
<h3>Printing Behavior Notes</h3>
<p>The printing implementation currently does a number of things that are normally 
  configurable in a standard word processor. The goals in this implementation 
  were primarily</p>
<ol>
  <li> A feature that would be relatively simple to use, and<br>
  </li>
  <li>Intermediate printouts for the translation process (as opposed to final 
    copy for publication.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus standard, implemented behavior includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Widow and orphan control - a single line in a paragraph will not be left 
    by itself on a page.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Keep-With-Next - Paragraphs such as section headings will not appear on 
    a page unless there is room to start their following paragraph.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Drop Caps - Chapter numbers are produced as drop capitals, such that they 
    take up two lines.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Footers - the contents of footers are set up in the Configuration dialog 
    and may include, e.g., the page number, the name of the book, the date of 
    the printout. <br>
  </li>
  <li> A line of text will not appear on a page unless all footnotes for that 
    line can also appear on that page.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Footnote letters begin with 'a' for each page (as opposed to beginning 
    with 'a' for each section as in the screen display.)<br>
  </li>
  <li> Pictures are centered; <i>OurWord</i> does not yet support wrap-around 
    text.<br>
  </li>
  <li> The watermark is automatically the Status of the book, centered on a 30 
    degree angle, using the largest font size that will fit in the available space.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Page margins, portrait vs landscape, page size, etc., are all whatever 
    is the default for the printer chosen. <i>OurWord</i> does not currently support 
    tweaking of these.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thee is tremendous complexity in printing; I have a new appreciation for the 
  programming behind software like <i>Microsoft Word</i>. Nevertheless, please 
  feel free to Send feedback as to issues that you find especially limiting. </p>
