<p><i>OurWord</i> uses a small, standard set of styles for paragraphs and characters. 
  Final typesetting will probably require additional styles, whereas <i>OurWord</i> 
  presents those which are typically used during drafting.</p>
<p>Styles are stored in the TeamSettings file. This allows you to set a style 
  once, and then use it for all of the teams working in the language cluster.</p>
<p>Styles are edited in the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, under the Team Settings 
  group on the left sidebar.</p>
<p>The various styles are shown in the list to the left; when you click on one 
  of these you will see its individual settings to the right, where you can make 
  changes to them. In the list, &quot;P&quot; represents a paragraph syle (which 
  has settings for both characters and paragraphs), and &quot;C&quot; represents 
  a character style (such as a chapter number).</p>
<p>For character settings, note that there are different font settings for each 
  <a href="WritingSystems.html">writing system</a>. This permits you to choose 
  a font and font height that works best for a given writing system.</p>
<p>The Restore Default Values button returns the entire stylesheet to its original 
  factory settings. </p>
