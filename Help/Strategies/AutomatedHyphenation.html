<p><i>OurWord</i> offers a quick-and-dirty means of hyphenation, which admittedly 
  will not be sufficient for some languages. Depending on expressed user interest, 
  future versions may incorporate a more rigorous approach to the problem. For 
  now, though, we hope that a reasonable number of language can benefit.</p>
<h3>1. Setup</h3>
<p>Hyphenation is set up in the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, under the <i>Team 
  Settings</i> section, the <a href="WritingSystems.html">Writing 
  Systems</a> tab. Because each writing system is potentially different, <i>OurWord</i> 
  permits you to set up a different hyphenation definition for each one. </p>
<p>1. You must first turn on the feature by changing &quot;<b><i>Turn On Auto-Hyphenation</i></b>&quot; 
  to &quot;<b><i>Yes</i></b>&quot;. By default it is set to &quot;<b><i>No</i></b>&quot;, 
  because automated hyphenation has a high potential to confuse new computer users.</p>
<p>2. At the heart of hyphenation is to specify a CV pattern, where you indicate 
  where the hyphen is permitted. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;VC-C&quot; works for many English words, such as &quot;bog-gle&quot;, 
    &quot;com-mit&quot;, and &quot;air-plane.&quot; Unfortunately it fails for 
    words such as &quot;pa-per,&quot; thus it is recognized that OurWord will 
    not completely cover all of the hyphenation rules of many languages.</li>
  <li>&quot;V-C&quot; works for Huichol words, where closed syllables do not exist, 
    thus &quot;p&uuml;-ca-heu-x&uuml;-ca-cai-ri&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please feel free to contact me with your requests on how I might enhance this 
  feature in the future to support your language. I do know that the &quot;right&quot; 
  way is to support the ICU library, and imagine that I will indeed at some point, 
  again, depending on user demand for this feature.)</p>
<p>3. You need to tell OurWord what your <i><b>consonants</b></i> are. Because 
  we then know the consonants and the punctuation, we can infer that everything 
  else is a vowel. </p>
<p>4. Finally, the &quot;<i><b>Min. Split Size</b></i>&quot; is your way of telling 
  OurWord not to break a word down into parts that are too small. Thus a minimum 
  size of three would prevent &quot;ap-ple&quot;, because &quot;ap&quot; would 
  be too small. </p>
<hr>
<h3>2. Behavior</h3>
<p>If turned on, hyphens are automatically created, and automatically update as 
  you type or otherwise edit the text. The hyphens appear outside of the white 
  background, indicating that the user cannot type on top of them. Hopefully the 
  user will not be tempted to type in hyphens, because doing so would cause them 
  to be part of the data. If you ever see a hyphen with a white background, it 
  was inserted by the user, not by OurWord.</p>
<p>If a single word becomes too long to fit in a line, and if hyphenation is turned 
  off (or if the hyphen rule does not apply), then OurWord will arbitrarily display 
  a hyphen in order to keep the line from overflowing from view on the screen. 
  Again, these hyphens are not inserted into the data, they merely appear on the 
  screen.</p>
<p>Hyphens are not yet implemented in the Print routine. I know, I know......stay 
  tuned.....and the more voices that request it, the higher this stuff moves up 
  on my To Do list.</p>
