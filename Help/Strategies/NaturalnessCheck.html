<p>The <i>Naturalness Check</i> window is a means by which the vernacular text 
  can be read without the clutter of verse numbers, chapter numbers, or the source 
  translation. The idea is that only the translation itself is visible, and the 
  translators or reviewers can read it for naturalness, making sure that the text 
  flows and the proper discourse elements are present.</p>
<p>When verse numbers are present, it is typical for a reader to pause and not 
  see where the text does not flow well. A pitfall of verse-by-verse translating 
  is that the flow of discourse can become abrubt and stilted. We suggest that 
  the translation be examined for naturalness multiple times throughout the translation 
  process; beginning from the completion of the first draft, all the way through 
  the consultant check at the end.</p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> provides several settings in the <i>Configuration</i> dialog 
  for the <i>Naturalness Check</i> view:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While we recommend that verse numbers be turned off, you can elect to turn 
    them on. Some teams find it useful to be able to reference the text via the 
    verse numbers.</li>
  <li>Similarly, you can turn line numbers on and off. We recommend that they 
    be turned on, so that you can reference the text by numbers that are off to 
    the side, rather than verse numbers which are embedded in the text. Thus a 
    group of people can gather around a computer monitor and say &quot;It really 
    does not flow well in line 32.&quot;</li>
