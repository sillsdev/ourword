<p>The main display of OurWord is to show the source/front translation on the 
  left, and the draft in the target language on the right. But often translators 
  want to refer to additional translations; and for that reason OurWord supports 
  the display of reference translations.</p>
<p>You first set up reference translations in the <i>Tools-Configuration</i> dialog. 
  There, under the <i>Reference</i> button, you specify these translations in 
  the same manner that you do for the front and target languages under the <i>Essentials</i> 
  tab. Thus you supply the name of the translation and the filenames for the various 
  books within it.</p>
<p>Once there are one or more reference translations defined for a given project, 
  then under the <i>Window</i> menu the &quot;<i>Show Reference Translations Pane</i>&quot; 
  item will be visible. Clicking on that item reveals the <i>Reference Translations</i> 
  pane. There, as you move around in the draft, the corresponding paragraph is 
  shown in each of the translations that you have defined.</p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> attempts to only show the paragraph that corresponds to the 
  current context. Sometimes this is difficult to calculate, and thus multiple 
  paragraphs are shown in the reference translation. This is not a bug; it simply 
  reflects the lack of structural correspondance between the target and the reference 
  translations.</p>
