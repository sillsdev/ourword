<p><i>OurWord</i> offers a behind-the-scenes backup feature, that silently creates 
  and archives backups during the course of daily usage without the user needing 
  to do anything. A command in the <i>Tools</i> dropdown allows a backup file 
  to be restored.</p>

<p>Backing up data has been a problem since the first days people began using 
  computers. The problems include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowing what files to back up,</li>
  <li>Knowing how to perform the backup</li>
  <li>Messing with backup media</li>
  <li>Remembering to do the backup</li>
  <li>Taking the time from busy schedules to do the backup</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been using a computer for very long, it is likely that either you 
  personally or someone you know has lost significant work due to the lack of 
  a backup. We have observed that new users especially find that making backups 
  is challenging, largely because of the difficulties in file management. </p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> has a behind-the-scenes solution. Other than an initial setup 
  in which a destination is chosen, the user is not bothered about backup again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The destination for these backups needs to be a device that can be written 
  many times. <i>OurWord</i> updates the backup every time the file is saved (which 
  it does automatically every 10 minutes). Thus a CD is not acceptable, because 
  a new CD would need to be inserted every 10 minutes (which most people would 
  find both annoying and expensive!)</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you use a flash memory device installed in the <font size="-1">PCMCIA</font> 
  slot of your computer. </p>

<p>As of March 2008, a 2Gig Compact Flash Card can be purchased for $US 25.00 
  (e.g., see <a href="http://www.memorysuppliers.com/sandisk1.html">Vendor Example</a>). 
  It plugs into an Adapter (roughly US $8) (<b>Note: I have no experience with 
  this vendor; it is an example only!</b>)</p>
<p>As shown below, the Card/Adapter Unit slides into the computer, and for all 
  practical purposes becomes conveniently part of the machine. If the translator 
  brings the computer to a workshop, the card is there. When the translator returns 
  to his home, the card is there. Backups thus can continue uninterrupted, no 
  matter where the laptop travels.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="UnitSlidesIn.JPG" width="595" height="264"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once installed, the memory device appears as a drive in <i>Windows Explorer</i>, 
  e.g., &quot;E:\&quot;. Files on it can be manipulated through Explorer in the 
  same manner as other devices such as the hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</table>
<p>In order to turn on Auto-Backup, use the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>. There 
  are two settings there:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A place to turn on/off the feature (the default is &quot;on&quot;)</li>
  <li>A place to indicate the folder in which to store the backup files. (If no 
    folder is specified, the user will be asked at runtime.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, we recommend that the folder be flash memory installed 
  in the <font size="-1">PCMCIA</font> slot. In the absence of a suitable device, 
  you can elect to identify a folder on your hard disk. This is better than nothing 
  (but just barely), as it does protect you should want to undo the changes you 
  made recently. But it does not protect you from a hard disk failure, which is 
  a real risk in many of the climates and electrical power situations in which 
  translation is typically done..</p>

<p>A file is restored through the <i>Restore from Backup</i> command on the <i>Tools</i> 
  dropdown. The command brings up the <i>Restore from Backup Dialog</i>. In this 
  dialog, you browse through a list of files to choose the one to restore from.

<h4>Backup FileNames</h4>
<p>When <i>OurWord</i> saves changes, it also creates a backup. The backup files 
  all have the day's date in the filename, thus: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ama-MRK-Draft-B - 2003 08 21.db</li>
  <li>Ama-MRK-Draft-B - 2003 08 22.db</li>
  <li>Ama-MRK-Draft-B - 2003 08 23.db</li>
  <li>Ama-MRK-Draft-B - 2004 02 04.db</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one backup file is created for a given day. Thus a file might be saved 
  many times during the course of the day; but the backup file only represents 
  the contents of the most recent save.</p>
<h4>Controlling proliferation</h4>
<p>If you work on the same book for many days, you will find that you are producing 
  a large number of backup files. In order to keep the number of files down, <i>OurWord</i> 
  discards some of the older files, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For files older than two weeks, only the last file for a given week is saved; 
    the others are deleted.</li>
  <li>For files older then two months, only the last file for a given month is 
    saved; the others are deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus if you edit the same book every day for an entire year, rather than 365 
  backup files, you will have</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 14 most recent daily files,</li>
  <li>6 recent weekly files,</li>
  <li>10 recent monthly files, </li>
  <li>for a Total of 30 files.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a book like Luke that weighs in at 400K, this would occupy 12 Meg on the 
  storage device.</p>
<p>Of course, you are encouraged to delete files from the storage device, or to 
  move them periodically to a CD Rom, where they can serve as a more permanent 
  archive. (This Backup feature does not pretend to function as a permanent archive.)</p>
