<p>The default mode of operation for <i>OurWord</i> is that the draft will match 
  the source/front translation in terms of structure. Thus if there is a quote 
  paragraph in the front, there will be a quote paragraph in the draft; if a section 
  has three paragraphs in the front, then there will be three corresponding paragraphs 
  in the draft.</p>
<p>While this is a good default means of working during drafting, typically there 
  comes a time where it is desired to make changes. Different paragraph breaks 
  might be desired, or different styles. Often these decisions are made together 
  with a consultant's input, and thus happen later during the translation process.</p>
<p>In order to make these types of changes to the draft, go to the <i>Tools-Setup 
  Features</i> dialog, and turn on <i>Structural Editing</i>. This results in 
  two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <i>Enter</i> and <i>Backspace</i> keys now serve to split or join paragraphs. 
    Thus if you want to add a new paragraph, simply press the <i>Enter</i> key 
    where you want the new paragraph to occur.</li>
  <li>The <i>Edit</i> drop-down menu offers a &quot;<i>Change Paragraph To</i>&quot; 
    command, by which you can change the style of the currently selected paragraph. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>(We anticipate supporting the insertion and deletion of footnotes in a soon-to-appear 
  future release of <i>OurWord</i> as a part of this<i> Structural Editing</i> 
  feature.)</p>
