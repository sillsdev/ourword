<h3>About Stages</h3>
<p><i>OurWord</i> defines these stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Draft - The translator(s) creates the draft from the front translation. 
    It is either drafted directly in OURWORD! or keyboarded from a handwritten 
    draft. It is common practice at this stage for team members to be drafting 
    separate chapters or sections of a book individually, but there are some who 
    prefer to do the initial draft as a team. (A draft is a computer-readable 
    Standard Format file.)<br>
  </li>
  <li> Team Revision - The entire team of translators review and revise the draft 
    together (e.g., if a single translator created the initial draft.) They check 
    that all of the meaning elements of the front translation are present, improve 
    naturalness, look at connectors, discuss lexical choice, etc.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Advisor Check - The revised draft is checked by the advisor with the team, 
    looking at exegetical accuracy, naturalness, connectors, lexical choice, etc.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Community Check - The advisor-checked draft is tested for comprehension 
    and naturalness with other speakers of the language who are relatively unfamiliar 
    with the Scriptures in general, and this translation in particular.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Back Translation - The community-checked draft is back translated into 
    English (or another language the consultant can handle competently at this 
    level), typically by the advisor, in preparation for the Consultant Check.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Consultant Check - A qualified translation consultant checks the community-checked 
    draft with another set of speakers of the language who are unfamiliar with 
    this translation<br>
  </li>
  <li> Final for Printing - The consultant-checked translation has completed all 
    stages and is ready for printing. Many have found it wise to do a fast editorial 
    read-through after the Consultant Check and before formatting it for final 
    printing. This often catches additional spelling and puncuation errors, and 
    can show up unnatural, awkward or forced transitions introduced by the adjustments 
    made during the consultant check. E.g. the changes were made looking at one 
    verse, but the read-through shows how it flows or doesn't flow from the context 
    of the previous verses.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Revision - for tweaks that typically occur between printing of an individual 
    book, and printing of the entire NT/Bible as a major publication. Or for a 
    revised edition of the NT. Languages change, and new ideas come to light that 
    can improve a translation in accuracy, clarity, naturalness, and discourse 
    structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stages can be customized via the <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, <i>Team 
  Settings</i> section.</p>
<h3>About Versions</h3>
<p><i>OurWord</i> supports versions within a stage. Thus, for example, a book 
  might go through several passes during a Community Check. These passes can be 
  versioned as 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. It is normal to increment the Version when 
  changes are made as a pass through the entire book.</p>
<h3>About File Names<br>
</h3>
<p><i>OurWord</i> controls the name of the file, and changes it as the Stages 
  and Versions are changed. The filename is composed of:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> LangAbbrev-BookAbbrev-StageAbbrev-Version-Date.db</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="../Reference/Filenames.html">File Names</a> for more detailed 
  information.</p>
<h3>Declaring a Book's Stage</h3>
<p>The stage information about a book is set in the <i>Book Properties Dialog</i>. 
  This dialog is accessed from the Configuration Dialog, by first clicking on 
  a book, and then clicking on the Properties button.</p>
<p>The dialog has controls so that you can enter the Stage and Version. (The default 
  is Stage=Draft and Version=A.. (Thus a default file name might be Ama-LUK-Draft-A.db.)</p>
<h3>Incrementing a book's stage</h3>
<p>The book's Stage and Versioncan be incremented through the <i>Increment Book 
  Status Dialog</i>. You access this through the Tools button. In this dialog, 
  there is an up-arrow beside each of the controls for Stage and Version. Clicking 
  on the appropriate arrow increments the corresponding value.</p>
<p>When a book's stage or version is changed, its filename is automatically changed. 
  <i>OurWord</i> will save your work to the new filename. All of your previous 
  files will remain on the disk; <i>OurWord</i> will not delete them. Thus each 
  time you increment the book's status, you are creating an archive of the previous 
  versions of the file.</p>
