<p><i>OurWord</i> does not currently offer a feature for making global changes. 
  These are changes which apply to the Front Translation and simultaneously to 
  all daughters currently in progress. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing the section breaks (e.g., splitting a long section into smaller 
    ones, or moving a verse from one section to another)</li>
  <li>Adding or removing pictures</li>
  <li>Adding or removing global footnotes or cross references</li>
  <li>Changing paragraph breaks</li>
  <li>Changing paragraph styles (e.g., changing a paragraph from &quot;p&quot; 
    to &quot;q&quot;.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A future version of <i>OurWord</i> will hopefully support these kinds of changes, 
  but in the meantime they must be done by hand. This means that you must load 
  each <font size="-1">DB</font> file into an editor (such as <i>Toolbox</i> or 
  <i>Paratext</i>) and make the changes there; then run <i>OurWord</i> to make 
  certain that everything works as expected. </p>
<p> <i>OurWord</i> has expectations about the standard format that it will accept, 
  and <a href="../GettingStarted/ImportBook/ImportBook.html">error messages are 
  presented</a> if you attempt to load a book which does not meet these expectations. 
  It is easy to introduce errors when working in a free-form editor such as <i>Toolbox</i>, 
  so we recommend that you minimize your use of such programs. I am hopeful that 
  future versions of <i>OurWord</i> will make outside editors less necessary.</p>
<p>When running <i>OurWord</i>, if you notice that paragraphs are not lining up 
  properly between Front and Target, that is a clue that there is a mismatch in 
  the underlying files. It may be something as simple as one paragraph being a 
  &quot;p&quot; while its corresponding one is a &quot;q&quot;. Or it may be that 
  the picture is not following the same verse between the two versions. It will 
  be helpful in such a case to use side-by-side windows in Toolbox to compare 
  the two, in order to discover what has changed.</p>
<p>If you are stumped, feel free to <a href="../Bookkeeping/ContactInformation.html">email</a> 
  me the offending files and I'll be happy to take a look. I'll need both the 
  Front and the Target files. </p>
