<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The main purpose of customizing the available features is to prevent the numerous 
  software options from overwhelming the newer user. When a person is struggling 
  to get the mouse to move, and to then hold it still long enough to click the 
  left button, and to learn the difference between the <font size="-1">DEL</font> 
  and the <font size="-1">BACKSPACE</font> keys; a simpler user interface is helpful. 
  The user is presented with only the choices needed to do the job, and the learning 
  curve is flattened considerably.</p>
<p>By toggling off some of the features, the user is protected. Consider the scenario 
  where a new user learns the basics of <i>OurWord</i> and immediately departs 
  for his remote village to begin drafting. If he inadvertantly removes his translation 
  from the Project settings, <i>OurWord</i> will no longer allow him to work on 
  his translation. He must then travel back to a location where a person can help 
  him. (Or alternatively, he must be taught about project setup and file management 
  and a host of similar concepts that have nothing to do with drafting.) Thus 
  by turning off the feature that performs Project setup, this situation is avoided.</p>
<p>A person's access to the program can grow with their experience. They might 
  begin with just the bare minimum to do drafting, and use <i>OurWord</i> in this 
  manner until they become proficent. At that time, a new feature can be turned 
  on, enabling to do an additional task. Thus as they grow in their work, they 
  also grow in their program use.</p>
<h3>Setup Features Dialog</h3>
<p>The <i>Setup Features Dialog</i> allows you to customize the user interface 
  of <i>OurWord</i> for individual users. Features can be turned on or off, depending 
  on what tasks the user needs to do, or depending on his proficiency with the 
  computer. The dialog is invoked from the <i>Setup Features</i> command of the 
  <i>Tools</i> dropdown.</p>
<p>The dialog lists all of the features that are available for turning on or off. 
  As you select a feature in the list, a description at the bottom of the dialog 
  tells more about it.</p>
<p>Placing a check beside a feature turns it on; clearing the checkmark turns 
  it off. </p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> defaults to having most features turned off, to reflect the 
  needs of newer users. As they gain more experience and confidence with computers, 
  it will be appropriate to turn on more of these features.</p>
<p>You can restrict access to this dialog through the <i>Password Protect</i> 
  button, which invokes the <i>Password Protect Dialog</i>. Thus if you are setting 
  up <i>OurWord</i> for other users, you can prevent them from tampering with 
  your setup by setting up a password. Take care to remember your password, as 
  without it you will not be able to get past this dialog.<font size="-1"> (Well, 
  there actually is a way, as no competent programmer would implement a password 
  scheme without creating a backdoor, but you'll have to email me.)</font></p>
