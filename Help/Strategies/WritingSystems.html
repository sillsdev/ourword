<h3>General</h3>
<p>We have struggled with the best way to handle writing systems for decades now. 
  I do not claim to have done any better than other software; in fact, it is highly 
  probable that what I've done here in <i>OurWord</i> is quite inadequate. Which 
  likely means a revision is in the future. But in the meantime.....here is what 
  we have:</p>
<p>A writing system, loosely defined, is intended to be all of the information 
  about displaying, sorting, and keyboarding for a given alphabet. A language 
  might have multiple such systems; but in most cases a language has only one.</p>
<p>Some examples of what writing systems describe:</p>
<ul>
  <li> That in Spanish, &quot;ll&quot; should be sorted as a single symbol<br>
  </li>
  <li> That in Tagalog, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are all 
    separate symbols.<br>
  </li>
  <li> That in many Chinese languages, a &quot;SimSun&quot; font will display 
    its fonts correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <i>LinguaLinks</i> (and then in <i>FieldWorks</i>), a writing system was 
  defined at the &quot;language&quot; level, meaning that a given language could 
  have a number of writing systems.</p>
<p>In designing <i>OurWord</i>, I have had a goal of wanting the software to work 
  for many languages with as little setup as possible. A part of that is that 
  I am attempting to permit a Writing System to be defined apart from individual 
  languages. Thus if all of the languages in a cluster can use a single Writing 
  System, it is not necessary define it over and over again each time a new translation 
  is begun.</p>
<p>Within the StyleSheet, for each individual style, you are able to define a 
  different font (font name, size, etc.) for each writing system. Thus a Book 
  Title in Chinese will likely have a different font than in English; and yet 
  for the paragraph style, you only need to define &quot;centered&quot; once.</p>
<p>I expect eventually merge <i>OurWord</i> writing systems with the model that 
  is supported by WeSay. </p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The <i>Configuration Dialog</i>, under the <i>Team Settings </i>section, allows 
  for writing systems information to be entered. Currently the following are allowed 
  for each:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A name for the writing system, which is the way to identify it elsewhere 
    in the software</li>
  <li>A short abbreviation / ID, which is currently used in interfacing with the 
    WeSay dictionary</li>
  <li>A keyboard name, which is used to support automatic switching of keyboards 
    (both Windows and KeyMan keyboards are supported.) <b>Note: </b>you need to 
    enter the name of the keyboard, not the abbreviation. Thus, e.g., enter &quot;<i>Thai 
    Kedmanee</i>&quot; rather than &quot;<i>TH</i>.&quot;</li>
  <li>Punctuation: a list of punctuation in the writing system</li>
  <li>End Punctuation: a list of punctuation that can occur following a word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a writing system is set up, then under a translation's settings (e.g., 
  under the &quot;Target&quot; tab under &quot;Essentials&quot;, you need to enter 
  the writing system for the two kinds of text: Advisor and Vernacular. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Vernacular - the translation</li>
  <li>Advisor - the back translation</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done, keyboard switching should be operational.</p>
<h3>Concerning general-purpose writing systems</h3>
<p>It is normal in language software to set up a separate writing system for each 
  language. However, if you note that the various languages in a cluster all use 
  the same orthography, keyboardings, etc., it is permissable to set up a single 
  writing system and have them all use it. <i>OurWord</i> defaults to a &quot;Latin&quot; 
  writing system, which will work for the many languages that use an English orthography. 
  Thus many languages can go ahead and use <i>OurWord</i> out of the box; others 
  with more complicated languages will need to do additional setup.</p>
<h3>Windows Repeated Keyboard Name Bug</h3>
<p>Windows has an unfortunate idea of what a program wants when it asks it for 
  the list of keyboards. Rather than give the actual name of the keyboard, it 
  often gives the name of a keyboard elsewhere in the list. As a result, you might 
  see the same keyboard name multiple times. This only happens when you have multiple 
  keyboards under a single language; thus the workaround is to move each keyboard 
  under its own separate language in your &quot;Regional and Language Options&quot; 
  control panel. That is, you probably need to pretend that your keyboard is actually 
  some other language. See <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Windows_Repeated_Keyboard_Name_Bug">http://wesay.org/wiki/Windows_Repeated_Keyboard_Name_Bug</a> 
  for more details.</p>
