<h3>How to Report a Bug</h3>
<p>If you find a bug in the software, it is very important that you provide enough 
  information that it can be duplicated on my machine. If I cannot duplicate it, 
  then I am very unlikely to be able to fix it. To that end, please <a href="ContactInformation.html">send</a> 
  the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Your Name,<br>
  </li>
  <li> Your contact information (e.g., your email address),<br>
  </li>
  <li> Your computer (processor speed, amount of memory, size of hard disk, anything 
    else you think might be helpful),<br>
  </li>
  <li> Your operating system (i.e., which flavor of Windows),<br>
  </li>
  <li> The version of <i>OurWord</i> you are using (Available in the Help-About 
    dialog.)<br>
  </li>
  <li> A description of the bug,<br>
  </li>
  <li> Step-by-step instructions to produce the bug,<br>
  </li>
  <li> Any screen shots or sample data if you think it will be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding a bug is not unlike the forensic science television shows that have 
  recently become popular. I must sift through various clues to try to find the 
  offending line of code. The more information you can provide, the more likely 
  I am to come up with the solution. Thank you in advance!</p>
<h3>How to Request a Feature</h3>
<p>I am always interested in ways in which I can improve OurWord. I am especially 
  interested in ideas of how I can take complicated computational tasks and make 
  them simple, so that translators can concentrate on the art of translating, 
  rather than the mechanics of operating a computer. If you have an idea or a 
  request, please <a href="ContactInformation.html">send</a> 
  the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Your Name,<br>
  </li>
  <li> Your contact information (e.g., your email address),<br>
  </li>
  <li> The nature of the idea / request,<br>
  </li>
  <li> Any reasoning/justification as to why this feature is desirable.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
