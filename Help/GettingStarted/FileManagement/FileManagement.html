<p>This article describes a strategy for dealing with a situation where a front 
  translation is serving several languages at once, and where these daughter languages 
  each have computers whose files need to be kept in synchronization, e.g., :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The latest version of the Front translation needs to be placed on each daughter's 
    machine</li>
  <li>Revisions of daughter's books need to be collected and then dissimenated 
    to the other machines (e.g., so that the Related Languages feature uses the 
    latest versions of each book.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It reflects lessons learned from two language clusters which were initial users 
  of <i>OurWord</i>. You will also want to review <a href="../SettingsManagement/SettingsManagement.html">Settings 
  Management</a> for an understanding of how <i>OurWord</i> handles its settings 
  files. </p>
<p>Note that now that <i>OurWord</i> 1.0 supports relative pathnames, this strategy 
  is less important to follow than it was in previous versions of <i>OurWord</i>. 
  However, we still include it here as several concepts, especially administrators 
  vs limited users, might be helpful.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1. Administrators and Limited Users</h3>
<p>We highly recommend that only a handful of people on the team have access and 
  authority to make changes, such as installing software, etc. This will make 
  each computer much more stable, especially if users are less computer literate. 
  Keep in mind that it may not be the translator who is the danger to the computer, 
  files, and project, but rather their hacker nieces and nephews who can unknowingly 
  trash a whole translation or introduce viruses. </p>
<p>Users are set up through the Control Panel-User Accounts. We recommend that 
  you password protect the Administrator; you may also wish to password protect 
  the Limited users. Refer to your Windows documentation for more information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. C:\BaseFolder</h3>
<p>Probably the key concept here is to place the data right off the C: drive, 
  as opposed to using <i>My Documents</i>. The problem with <i>My Documents</i> 
  is that it introduces differences to path names on various computers, e.g., 
  the full paths on your computers will differ along the lines of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>C:\Documents and Settings\<b>Tombulu</b>\My Documents\OurWordData</li>
  <li>C:\Documents and Settings\<b>Tondano</b>\My Documents\OurWordData</li>
  <li>C:\Documents and Settings\<b>Totemboan</b>\My Documents\OurWordData</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, if you place the data directly on the C: drive, you get a folder along 
  the lines of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>C:\OurWordData</li>
</ul>
<p>This can thus be copied from machine to machine, without ever having any problems 
  with resolving pathnames. (Actually, <i>OurWord</i> handles relative pathnames, 
  so a My Documents solution should work if it is the only software you are using. 
  But you are likely to run into problems with other software; whereas coming 
  off of &quot;C:\&quot; is guaranteed to remove any potential problems.)</p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> does not care what you name the base folder. You can use &quot;OurWordData&quot;, 
  or you can use something more appropriate to your context.</p>
<p><b>Important: </b>You will need to give your limited users access to this folder. 
  While logged in as an Administrator, open the Windows Explorer and right-click 
  over the folder, then choose Properties. Via this Properties Dialog, you can 
  grant all of your users read and write access. </p>
<p>If you are on a network, it may also be useful to share the folder for convenient 
  access. I recommend that you share it with the language name, e.g., so that 
  it appears as &quot;OurWordData-Tombulu&quot; on the network.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Language Folders</h3>
<p>Given that we now have a base folder at C:\, the next step is to create subfolders 
  for each language, thus:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="Folders1.JPG" width="418" height="310"></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>4. Settings Folders</h3>
<p>I prefer to hide settings files; I feel they are annoying to see when browsing 
  for files. If you are using Toolbox (Shoebox) together with <i>OurWord</i>, 
  you are likely to have numerous settings files. I tend to thus create a Settings 
  folder underneath each language, e.g., </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><img src="Folders2.JPG" width="418" height="352"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these settings folders, you will want to save the Project (<font size="-1">OWP</font>) 
  and Translation (<font size="-1">OTRANS</font>) files that you create through 
  <i>O<font size="-1">UR</font>W<font size="-1">ORD</font></i>. Thus, for example, 
  the project file for the Tombulu language would have the path:</p>
<ul>
  <li>c:\OurWordData\Tombulu\Settings\Tombulu.owp</li>
</ul>
<p>And the translation description file would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>c:\OurWordData\Tombulu\Settings\Tombulu.otrans</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3>5. Pictures</h3>
<p>I recommend that you create a separate folder under C:\ to hold the pictures. 
  This can be something like</p>
<ul>
  <li>C:\Graphics or </li>
  <li>C:\Pictures</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, you will place the pictures that you will use in Scripture.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> <i>OurWord</i> (and most Windows programs nowadays) no longer 
  support the <font size="-1">PCX</font> format, so if you have such pictures, 
  you will need to convert them to another format (such as <font size="-1">TIF</font> 
  or <font size="-1">JPEG</font>).</p>
<p>In your Scripture files, you will then have paths to these pictures. This will 
  be something like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\cat C:\Graphics\HK-LB\LB00234C.TIF</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, by placing these all at C:\ rather than in <i>My Documents</i>, none 
  of the software you use will have any trouble resolving the pathnames to locate 
  these pictures. </p>

<h3>6. The Master Computer</h3>
<p>You will want to choose one computer that will serve as the master. The process 
  will be that you are continually &quot;harvesting&quot; files from the individual 
  languages onto the master; and then copying the entire OurWordData folder from 
  the master back down to the individual computers.</p>
<p>The Master will also be the one you will want to have a backup process working 
  for.</p>
<hr>
<h3>7. Processes</h3>
<p><b>7.1 Harvesting Data. </b>Periodically, you will want to collect data from 
  the individual languages. In a networked office situation, this can be done 
  frequently; if you are in the situation where translators are carrying their 
  laptops away for months at a time, then you will not be able to do this as often. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine which Scripture files have been changed, then after checking for 
    viruses, copy them to the Master Computer</li>
  <li>If the file name for any of these Scripture files has changed (e.g., the 
    book status has been incremented, then you will also need to copy the <font size="-1">OTRANS</font> 
    file to the <i>Master Computer</i>.)</li>
  <li>Copy these files into their corresponding folders on the Master Computer. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>After copying the files from a team computer, it is wise to increment the filenames 
  of all books still in process. This avoids accidental overwrite of files if 
  the translator has forgotten to increment a file after working on it.</p>
<p><b>7.1 Setup a new language. </b>To set up a new language, or to change the 
  setup for an existing language:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Harvest any data from the computer you will be changing (for a new language, 
    there will not yet be any data to harvest)</li>
  <li>On the Master Computer, create the folders as described above</li>
  <li>On the Master Computer, launch <i>OurWord</i> and create (or modify) the 
    settings for that language.</li>
  <li>Copy the entire OurWordData file to the new language's computer</li>
</ol>
<p><b>7.1 Update individual computers. </b>To update the computers in the project, 
  you mainly only need to copy the <i>OurWordData</i> file from the <i>Master 
  Computer</i> onto their <i>C:\ </i>drive.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Important: </b>Make sure you have harvested any data that has been edited 
    on this computer! Otherwise, you will copy over it and thus lose it (but do 
    keep in mind that there are backups should this happen.) </li>
  <li>Optional: You may want to delete all of the subfolders on their computer 
    before beginning the copy in the next step. The reason is that as people <a href="../../Strategies/TranslationStages.html">change 
    a book's status</a>, it will result in a growing number of files on the disk. 
    By removing the subfolders, then when the copy is done, only the most current 
    Scripture files will be on the disk.</li>
  <li>Copy the <i>OurWordData</i> from the <i>Master Computer</i> onto their <i>C:</i> 
    drive</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>8. Archival</h3>
<p>On the Master Computer, you may also want to create an additional base folder, 
  e.g., OurWordDataArchive, in which you store older files. Thus when a Scripture 
  file's status is upgraded from &quot;Draft&quot; to &quot;Consultant Check&quot;, 
  you can keep the older copies of these files around for future reference. </p>
<p>You would typically not place these in the normal OurWordData folder, because 
  this would just provide clutter, as well as increase the time needed to do the 
  computer updates. </p>
