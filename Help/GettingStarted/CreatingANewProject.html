<p>A Project consists of the top-level settings that have all of the information 
  <i>OurWord</i> needs to work with a translation. It includes identifying the 
  source translation, specifying the writing systems, describing the style sheet, 
  and numerous other settings. </p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> provides a wizard to walk you through the most essential settings 
  that it needs in order to create a new project. You access this wizard through 
  the <i>Project-New Project</i> dropdown menu. Once these settings have been 
  supplied, the new project is created. You can then go through the <i>Tools-Configure</i> 
  dropdown menu in order to fine-tune these settings, or to enter more advanced 
  options. </p>
<p>The various settings that are available for a project are the subject of the 
  majority of the topics in this help documentation. Refer to the <a href="../Index.html">Table 
  of Contents</a> for further help on these individual topics.</p>
