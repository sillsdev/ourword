<!-- #BeginEditable "Contents" --> 
<p>This error occurs when the contents of a section differ significantly from 
  the Front translation. <i>OurWord</i> expects each section to have the same 
  number of pictures (if any); and if there are paragraphs before (or after) the 
  picture in the front, then there should likewise be paragraphs before (or after) 
  the picture in the translation. </p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> has this requirement so that it can correctly lay out the side-by-side 
  display. It is our assumption that in a Front Translation strategy, the vernacular 
  will follow the Front closely enough that such structure will not be an issue.</p>
<p><i>An example of this error:</i><br>

<p>The cure is to examine the front to see what is different, and then edit the 
  vernacular so that there are no differences in structure. If you are unsure, 
  go ahead and attempt a fix and <i>Try Again</i>, and <i>OurWord</i> will let 
  you know if you still have work to do. </p>
<p>After you make the correction, click on the <i>Try Again</i> button to instruct 
  <i>OurWord</i> to resume importing the book; or alternatively you can click 
  on <i>Cancel</i> to abandon the import and fix it in some other editor. </p>
