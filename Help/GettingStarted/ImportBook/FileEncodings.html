<p>Once upon a time computer memory and speed was much, much smaller than today, 
  and computers only permitted a total of 256 different letters<font size="2" color="#0000CC"><a href="#fn1">1</a></font> 
  to be displayed. Half of these were set in stone, the other half could be customized 
  to meet the needs of various writing systems. And so with the many different 
  languages spoken around the world, fonts were created that would interpret these 
  limited numbers into the shapes that the orthography needed.</p>
<p>The result was, of course, chaos. It is impossible to interpret one of these 
  files without having a font to go with it. And so as computers became faster 
  and memory became cheaper, it was decided to devote more memory to storing each 
  letter, and to create a standard, so that each and every different shape would 
  be represented by a unique number.</p>
<p>And so Unicode was born. </p>
<p>There are several flavors of Unicode, but we have standardized on one known 
  as UTF-8. We prefer UTF-8 because for those writing systems which only need 
  the original 256 letters, the files continue to be the original, small size; 
  yet for those writing systems that need more the standard readily handles them.</p>
<p>And so, English, Chinese, Hebrew and Greek can all be represented in a single 
  file. </p>
<p>Microsoft, in the meantime, had come up with a Codepages concept, where a file 
  could be interpreted according to a different &quot;page&quot;, and fonts designed 
  for that page. And thus standards such as &quot;Western European (Windows) 1251&quot; 
  became commonplace.</p>
<p>The Unicode standard places three characters at the beginning of a file to 
  identify its Encoding. These characters are hidden from you by the software 
  you use to view the file, but they are valuable to the software in knowing how 
  to read the data. When OurWord finds these three characters, it knows what to 
  do. When they are nowhere to be found, then neither OurWord nor any other computer 
  program on the planet have a clue how to interpret the file. The information 
  must either exist in some settings file somewhere, or in someone's brain; otherwise 
  the data cannot be interpreted.</p>
<p>The world is moving to Unicode. We want to leave the chaos of these &quot;legacy&quot; 
  systems, and move to an ordered world where we know what the data means. <i>OurWord</i> 
  thus expects UTF8.</p>
<p>If <i>OurWord</i> does not see the Unicode three characters (known as the BOM, 
  or Byte Order Mark), then it has no choice but to declare that it can't interpret 
  the file, and ask for your help. You have two choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convert the file to UTF8 yourself, either by running it through some conversion 
    software, or by getting help from an encodings specialist.</li>
  <li>Use the Specify Encoding dialog to tell <i>OurWord</i> how to interpret 
    the file. This latter option only works when the entire file was encoded in 
    some legacy standard (such as &quot;Western European (Windows) 1251.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Specify Encoding dialog you are shown how the file will look under the 
  various possibile interpretations. If you find an interpretation that results 
  in all of the letters looking correct, then you are probably OK to proceed with 
  importing the file. But if you have any question at all, you should ask for 
  help. Encodings are complicated, and not something you should attempt on your 
  own if you do not understand the technological issues.</p>
<p>Toolbox users pose a special case, in that Toolbox does not output the BOM 
  characters. Toolbox allows individual fields within a file to be UTF8, and other 
  fields within that same file to be legacy encodings. If you have such files 
  as these, <i>OurWord</i> cannot convert your data; you will most definitely 
  lose data if you try. Please get help from a specialist. On the other hand, 
  if you imported an <i>OurWord</i> file into Toolbox and then used Toolbox to 
  write it back out, then you are fine to have <i>OurWord</i> interpret it as 
  UTF8. </p>

<p><super><font size="2" color="#0000CC"><a name="fn1"></a>1</font></super> This 
  is a simple introduction; I'm using &quot;letters&quot; inprecisely, rather 
  than terms such as characters, graphemes, glyphs, and such. And I'm altogether 
  ignoring diacritics. This is meant to be a rough explanation; not a detailed 
  how-to manual.</p>
