<p><i>OurWord</i> currently supports two flavors of Standard Format: (1) the <a href="../../Reference/FileFormat.html">format</a> 
  used in <i>Shoebox/Toolbox</i>, and (2) a <a href="../../Reference/USFMFormat.html">subset</a> 
  of <font size="-1">USFM</font> that is used by <i>Paratext</i>. </p>
<h3>Starting the Import Process</h3>
<p>Import is initiated via the Import button in the <i>Configuration</i> dialog. 
  This button first brings up a wizard by which you supply basic information about 
  the file:</p>
<p>The first step in the wizard is for you to browse for the file that you wish 
  to import. After you navigate to the file, the wizard does a quick scan of the 
  file to determine whether or not it is one which can be imported, and displays 
  information (or error messages) as appropriate. Only after a suitable file has 
  been supplied with the <font size="-1">NEXT</font> button become enabled, so 
  that you can proceed to the next page in the wizard.</p>
<p>The second step is for you to identify the book being imported. This is a matter 
  of choosing one of the possible 66 books from a list. <i>OurWord</i> will only 
  show those books that are possiblities, thus if you do not see your book in 
  the list...</p>
<ul>
  <li> The book may have already been imported<br>
  </li>
  <li>If you are importing a book into your translation, that book must already 
    be defined in the Front translation; if it has not yet been defined there, 
    then it will not appear in this list.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The third step gives you the option of supplying additional information about 
  the book. For the Stage, you can indicate whether the book is, e.g., a draft, 
  or has been back translated, or has been consultant checked, etc. For the Version, 
  you can append an optional letter to indicate, e.g., how many passes have been 
  made through the draft. (There is more information about Stages and Versions 
  <a href="../../Strategies/TranslationStages.html">here</a>.) </p>
<p>The fourth step in the wizard allows you to specify the folder where the file 
  will be stored. <i>OurWord</i> has its own <a href="../../Reference/Filenames.html">naming 
  system</a> for filenames, through which you can see at a glance the book's language, 
  abbreviation, stage, and version. <i>OurWord</i> does not give you control over 
  the filename, but does let you decide into which folder you want it to be placed. 
  You will normally want to store all of the books of a translation together on 
  your hard disk.</p>
<p>Once this information has been entered, the wizard displays a summary page 
  of the decisions you have made. Clicking on <i>Finish</i> will ccause <i>OurWord</i> 
  to proceed with the import.</p>
<h3>Running into problems</h3>
<p>It is very common for a book which was created by other software to not import. 
  Standard Format can be a slippery animal, and mistakes in the use of markers, 
  or in their order, or numerous other items can result in an error condition. 
  In this case, <i>OurWord</i> will complain of the error, and will put up an 
  editor by which you can attempt to solve the problem. (Or alternatively you 
  can exit <i>OurWord</i> and do the fix in other software.) </p>
<p>The following error messages may appear when importing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Err_BadChapterNo.html"> Bad Chapter Number</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_MissingParagraphMarker.html"> Missing Paragraph Marker</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_MissingParagraphMarkerForCF.html"> Missing Paragraph Marker 
    for \cf field</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_MissingParagraphMarkerForNote.html"> Missing Paragraph Marker 
    for Note</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_MissingVerseNumber.html"> Missing Verse Number</a></li>
  <li><a href="Err_NoVerseInSection.html">Missing Verse in Section</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_StructureMismatch.html"> Structure Mismatch</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="Err_StructureSectionMiscount.html"> Structure Section Miscount</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Examine the Results</h3>
<p>Unfortunately it is not always possible to correctly import these files, because 
  the files often have errors and unrecognized markers within them; so you are 
  strongly encouraged to carefully review the book once it has been imported into 
  <i>OurWord</i> to make sure that everything appears correctly. If not, you may 
  wish to edit the book in your external editor, and then do the import again.</p>
