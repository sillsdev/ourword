<!-- #BeginEditable "Contents" --> 
<p>To set up a new, blank book to translate, follow the stebs below. All of this 
  is done in the Configuration dialog, which is accessed through the Tools dropdown. 
  (If the Configuration dialog is not visible, use the Setup Features dialog to 
  turn it on.)</p>
<p><b>1. Make sure that the corresponding book exists in the Source / Front Translation</b>. 
  In <i>OurWord</i>, a book in the vernacular is not edited by itself; it must 
  be created from another book; and thus will use that book's decisions for section 
  breaks, paragraph styles, etc. Thus is it impossible to create a blank book 
  unless you have first told <i>OurWord</i> about the source book.</p>
<p>As shown below, the Books tab shows the list of books for a given translation 
  (in this case, for the <i>Kupang</i> language.) You can use the Import button 
  to bring in a file into this source language.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>2. Press the Create button in the target translation.</b> In the <i>Target</i> 
  tab (in this illustration, this is the <i>Pura</i> language), again in the Books 
  tab, click on the <i>Create</i> button..</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><b>3. Supply information about the book. </b>In response to the <i>Create</i> 
  button, <i>OurWord</i> presents a wizard that will walk you through the process. 
  It first has you choose which book (based on what is available, see #1 above), 
  and then has you identify the folder into which you wish to store the new book. 
  Upon finishingi the wizard, the new, empty book should appear in the list of 
  books for the target translation. You can use the Book button in the main toolbar 
  to bring it up onto the screen for editing.</p>
