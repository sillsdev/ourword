<p><i>OurWord</i> considers users to fit into one of two possible roles:</p>
<p><b>Indigenous Translators</b> who typically have had little, if any, prior 
  computer experience. They don't need to worry about the complexities of file 
  management, writing systems, installations, and the like. Rather, they want 
  to concentrate on the science and art of Bible translation. <i>OurWord</i> was 
  especially designed to hide software complexity from the translator, in order 
  to enable the inexperienced computer user to quickly become productive and sucessful 
  in his dream of tranlating the Word of God into his own language.</p>
<p>However, complexity must be dealt with, and it is the <b>Advisor</b> who does 
  so. The advisor is the person who makes decisions about how files should be 
  organized; about how the language shoud be keyboarded, or about which tasks 
  the translator is ready to tackle--and it is then the advisor who sets up <i>OurWord</i> 
  to support these decisions.</p>
<p><i>OurWord</i> places these Adivsor settings into two dialogs, both accessed 
  under the <i>Tools</i> dropdown:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Configuration</b> is used to set up all aspects of a translation project</li>
  <li><b>Features</b> is used to set up which user interface items are turned 
    on for the translator. </li>
</ul>
<p>The other areas of the software are expected to be used by the translator.</p>
<p>Of course, some people will fill the roles of both translator <i><b>and</b></i> 
  advisor. In fact, we would hope that as translators gain in experience and confidence, 
  that they in turn might become advisors for other translators. </p>
