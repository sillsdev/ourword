<p><i>OurWord</i> is editing software designed to support the mother-tongue translator 
  as he translates the Word of God into his own language.</p>
<p>One could argue that any editor would be fine for Bible translation. And indeed 
  if the main requirement is that a person can type and modify text, then software 
  such as Notepad would suffice. But <i>OurWord</i>'s purposes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>providing an easy-to-learn, user friendly tool for translators who typically 
    have had little, if any, prior experience using computers,</li>
  <li>organizing the task in a manner that is most conducive to sucessful Bible 
    translation. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>OurWord</i> was initially developed in Timor, Indonesia, to support the 
  method of translation that is done there. The translators in the numberous local 
  languages of Timor draft from the carefully-crafted Kupang Malay translation. 
  Kupang Malay is the language of wider communication in the region. Translators 
  have found that by using the Kupang as a &quot;front&quot; translation, meaning 
  that they follow its exegesis and strategies, that they can quickly produce 
  high-quality translations in their own languages. OurWord was conceived as a 
  means of supporting this process of drafting from a front translation, and the 
  initial version was introduced there in late 2004.</p>
<p>A front translation, by the way, is merely another means of doing adaptation. 
  The Timor translators evaluated more traditional computer adaptation before 
  settling on the &quot;manual adaptation&quot; method that they currently use. 
  (The distinction between computer and manual adaptation is discussed <a href="ManualVsComputerAdaptation.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Having observed that most translators prefer to draft from a single &quot;main&quot; 
  source text (though frequently with access to the Scriptures in other translations 
  for reference purposes,) and having seen that <i>OurWord</i>'s presentation 
  has indeed proven effective for newer computer users; <i>OurWord</i> was generalized 
  to support translation projects which do not work from a front translation. 
  The Huichol Old Testament project of Mexico provided the proving ground, as 
  translators drafted Huichol from one of the Spanish translations. And thus OurWord 
  has become a general translation editing tool appropriate for numerous translation 
  situations.</p>
<p>Early versions of Microsoft Word had a feature known as &quot;Side-by-Side 
  Paragraphs.&quot; Microsoft discontinued the feature in later versions, but 
  it served as the basis for <i>OurWord</i>'s user interface. We place the source 
  paragraph on the left, and a empty space to type the translation of that paragraph 
  on the right. The rest of the software is built upon that foundational notion 
  of editing. You can get a feel for the editing experience by downloading the 
  Walkthrough from the web site, at <a href="http://ourword.theseedcompany.org">ourword.theseedcompany.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are new to <i>OurWord</i>, I recommend that you begin with the walkthrough. 
  This includes doing a translation exercise with the sample data. Once you have 
  completed this you should have a good understanding of the approach that <i>OurWord</i> 
  takes. You might then review the topics under the <i>Getting Started</i> section 
  of the <a href="../Index.html">Table of Contents</a> in these helps. </p>
<p>May God bless you richly as you work to bring his word to the peoples of the 
  world. </p>
