<p>In <i>OurWord</i> we are attempting to distinguish between Computer and Manual 
  Adaptation.</p>
<p>For experienced Bible translators, computer adaptation is a familiar concept. 
  With programs such as <i>Carla</i> or <i>AdaptIt</i>,</p>
<ol>
  <li>A source text is selected which represents solid exegesis and careful translation</li>
  <li>The computer then generates a draft in the target translation.</li>
</ol>
<p>We would posit that the major innovation here is not &quot;computer,&quot; 
  but rather, &quot;adaptation.&quot; With adaptation, a decision is being made 
  to use the exegesis, rendering decisions, translation strategies, etc., of a 
  source language; thus saving many, many years of work in a typical New Testament 
  Project. Adaptation frequently cuts the time to produce a translation at least 
  in half.</p>
<p>An adaptation project still requires all of the translation processes that 
  would accompany a first draft in a non-adaptation project. Thus the draft must 
  be team checked, advisor checked, community checked, back translated, consultant 
  checked, etc. Thus twenty years may be cut to severn to ten, but the necessary 
  down-stream checking prevents an adaptation from published instantaneously.</p>
<p>Thus if Adaptation can be defined to use a source text as the basis of translation, 
  then</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Computer Adaptation</i> involves having the computer produce the first 
    draft by exchanging words from source langauge into target language</li>
  <li><i>Manual Adaptatio</i>n involves having a translator produce the first 
    draft by translating directly from the source language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, trials have demonstrated that there is no measurable time difference 
  between Manual vs Xomputer adaptation.The reason is that while Computer Adaptation 
  can quickly produce something in a target language, that raw draft almost always 
  requires a first pass to edit out the computerisms. Thus Computer Adaptation 
  plus Raw Draft Processing seems to take about the same amount of time as a Manual 
  Adaptation's single translation pass.</p>
<p>There are numerous factors to consider when choosing between Computer and Manual 
  Adaptation, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If languages are so distance that speakers of the target cannot understand 
    the source, then manual adaptation is not possible. However, a good linguist 
    equipped with Carla can sometimes make computer adaptation viable.</li>
  <li>If languages are so very similar that only a handful of words are changing, 
    such that little post-processing is required, then a Computer Adaptation strategy 
    using Adapt It will probably be the fastest way to get a good result.</li>
  <li>In Manual Adaptation, certain sociolinguistic factors are addressed. For 
    example, in Computer Adaptation the receiptients often feel that they are 
    making a &quot;copy&quot; of the translation of a language that for whatever 
    reason, they disdain. With Manual Adaptation this usually does not happen, 
    because the translator feels like he is starting out with a blank slate and 
    creating his own translation.</li>
  <li>With Computer Adaptation, the translator is learning a different skill set: 
    that of correcting the computer. Thus if the computer has produced stilted 
    language, or has transferred strangenesses from the source language, the translator 
    is learning the skills to clean these up. With Manual Adaptation, on the other 
    hand, the translator merely translates, and thus can be trained solely in 
    translation skills. </li>
  <li>With Computer Adaptation, you must teach the translator to overcome that 
    feeling of &quot;if the computer suggested it, then it must be right.&quot; 
    It is common for new and experienced users alike to put too much trust in 
    the computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which to choose, we suggest that you conduct a trial. Choose 
  passages of similar genre, and let the translator work with both approaches. 
  Your key metric should be about which produces the best translation in your 
  situation, especially taking into account the types of things that must be fixed 
  under each method as the translation proceeds through the various downstream 
  checks. Thus ideally your trail would involve taking the results from both types 
  of adaptation all the way through the translation process.</p>
