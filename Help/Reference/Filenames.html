<p><i>OurWord</i> controls the name of the file. The file name is composed of 
  information about the book, and the name changes as this information is changed. 
  (For example, if the book's stage is changed from &quot;Draft&quot; to &quot;Team 
  Check&quot;, the filename will change to indicate the new stage.) The filename 
  is composed of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> LangAbbrev-BookAbbrev-StageAbbrev-Version-Date.db</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> LangAbbrev</b> is typically the Ethnologue 3-Letter code, or some other 
    shortened abbreviation of the language name. It is set in the Translation 
    Properties Dialog.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b> BookAbbrev</b> is typically the standard 3-Letter SIL/UBS book abbreviations, 
    but short abbreviations in other languages are also supported.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b> Stage </b>is one of the stages as defined in Tracking a Book's Stages 
    of Translation.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b> Version</b> is a editing major pass, of the form 'A', 'B', 'C', etc. 
    When changes are made in a pass through an entire book, a Version should be 
    used.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Date is the date the file was last modified by <i>OurWord</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the filename Ama-LUK-Adv-B 2008-01-17.db would be interpreted 
  as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ama - The Amarasi language<br>
  </li>
  <li> LUK - Luke<br>
  </li>
  <li> Adv - Advisor Check Stage<br>
  </li>
  <li> B - Version B<br>
  </li>

<p>When importing a book, the Import Dialog provides the opportunity to declare 
  the book's stage and version information. Subsequent saves will result in the 
  file being saved to the appropriate filename that is generated from this information.</p>
