<p>Use the following process to import files in Toolbox Scripture Standard Format 
  into <i>OurWord</i>: </p>
<p>1. Check (e.g., in <i>Shoebox</i> or <i>Toolbox</i>) to see if the file to 
  be imported has the same number of records as the Front Translation. If not, 
  work through the<i> \rcrd</i> and <i>\s</i> fields until you get them to match. 
  The simplest way from within Toolbox is to activate one of the files by clicking 
  on the top bar, and then look down at the bottom bar where it will tell you 
  how many records the file has (e.g. 11/96 means you are looking at record number 
  11 out of 96 total records in the file). Then click on the other file and see 
  if it has the same total number of records.</p>
<p>2. Try to import the file into <i>OurWord</i>.</p>
<p>3. If it doesn't accept it, <i>OurWord</i> should give a message alerting you 
  to the (first) reason encountered. (If <i>OurWord</i> does not give a message, 
  this is a bug and should be reported. Please email both the Front and the Target 
  files.)</p>
<p>4. When a file is newly accepted into <i>OurWord</i>, visually skim through 
  each record.</p>
<ul>
  <li> mismatches in paragraphing will be fairly obvious<br>
  </li>
  <li> mismatches in placement of footnotes will be fairly easy to spot<br>
  </li>
  <li> text not yet entered will be fairly easy to spot</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Jot each reference on a piece of paper, with a shorthand note of the type 
  of fix needed</p>
<p>6. Close <i>OurWord</i>, and open the file back up in Toolbox, side-by-side 
  with the Front Translation file. Go straight to the references noted and clean 
  them up there.</p>
<p>This approach is significantly faster than going meticulously through a whole 
  file carefully looking at all the SFM codes to see that they match.</p>
