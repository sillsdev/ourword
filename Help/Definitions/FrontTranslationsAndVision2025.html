<p>I have come to feel that this idea of a front translation is potentially a 
  key to whether Vision 2025 is reachable or not.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="A"></a>A GOOD FRONT TRANSLATION CAN EMPOWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO 
  DO GOOD BIBLE TRANSLATION<br>
</h3>
<p>In the Timor context, what has developed on its own is that one of our translations 
  in a language of wider communication (Kupang) has come to be used as a source 
  text, or front translation, for other vernacular translations in the region. 
  Local translation teams <i>have formed themselves</i> and begun drafting in 
  at least 10 languages without any effort on our part to get them started. They 
  catch the vision, see it as do-able, and begin drafting, simply because the 
  need is self-evident, and the way to do it is obvious upon contact with the 
  Kupang translation. In several languages, these locally-motivated teams have 
  drafted the entire gospel of Mark before they contact us at the university to 
  find out what is the next step. The church directs them to us at the university, 
  because we are the technical arm commissioned by the church to train and supervise 
  Bible translation. In the Timor region (as in most of Indonesia) this reaction 
  and response has never happened with the national language scriptures. In fact, 
  the national language scriptures make the idea of vernacular translation seem 
  an impossible task. <i>The front translation has motivated and empowered local 
  communities to translate the scriptures in their own language.</i><br>
</p>
<h3><a name="B"></a>THE FRONT TRANSLATION HAS GONE THROUGH ALL THE TRANSLATION 
  STEPS:<br>
</h3>
<p>In the context of Timor, our front translation is a <i>real full-blown translation</i> 
  in a Malay-based creole (Kupang Malay) which, in addition to being a first language 
  for around 200,000 speakers, also functions as a language of wider communication 
  for another 100,000 to 200,000 second language speakers who also speak perhaps 
  50 vernacular languages representing about 1.2&#150;1.5 million people. Speakers 
  of these other vernacular languages are using the Kupang Malay scriptures (not 
  the national language Indonesian) as a front translation or source text for 
  drafting their vernacular scriptures.<br>
</p>
<p>By a &quot;real translation&quot; I mean one that is <i>drafted by MTT's</i><font size="-1"><super>(<a href="#1">1</a>)</super></font> 
  (I will address from what later), reworked in detail by the translation team 
  plus a translation consultant-trainer-adviser. This pass cleans up exegetical 
  issues, discourse repackaging, lexical choice, implicit-to-explicit issues, 
  and naturalness. Once the team is satisfied with it, the translation goes through 
  one or more <i>verse-by-verse community checks</i> with groups of uninitiated 
  native speakers. These checks are critical for the normal comprehension and 
  smoothing reasons, but, working in a creole there is the additional factor of 
  having to check understanding of terms and certain functors by people from different 
  ethnic backgrounds (who, even though they are all native speakers of the creole, 
  often have slightly different understandings of the meaning or implications 
  of the same term). After doing a <i>back-translation</i> (a separate and complex 
  issue in itself), the translation then goes through a full <i>verse-by-verse 
  consultant check</i> with a different group of UNS's and a qualified translation 
  consultant who has not been involved in the translation of that book. The book 
  is then published and distributed widely after being formally launched by the 
  synod leaders. We make a larger format spiral-bound edition of the translation 
  available to translators who will use it as a front translation (the spiral 
  binding lays open better than the printer's' binding).<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="C"></a>THE FRONT TRANSLATION IN TIMOR IS STRUCTURED LIKE THE LOCAL 
  LANGUAGES: <br>
</h3>
<p>Because it is a Malay-based <i>creole</i>, it is an Austronesian-based language 
  in the same family as most of the vernaculars in the region (vernacular Malays 
  are from the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian, whereas the languages 
  around Timor and Maluku are Central Malayo-Polynesian languages). As a creole, 
  it has calqued on the grammars, lexicons, idioms, and semantic categories of 
  the local languages and cultures. In other words, <i>Kupang strings information 
  together like the local vernaculars do. </i>The national language does not, 
  and the national language translations certainly do not. This is important to 
  understand.</p>
<h3><a name="D"></a>THE PROBLEM OF THE TENDENCY TO TRANSLATE LITERALLY:</h3>
<p>We have observed over the years that no matter how much prior translation training 
  you give someone, they <i>tend to translate their first book fairly literally</i>, 
  or at best modified literal. This is just as true of SIL-trained ex-pat translators 
  as it is of MTT's. It takes a good translation consultant to ask the right questions 
  of the UNS's to demonstrate to the novice translators that the message just 
  isn't getting through with that kind of semi-literal translation. It is because 
  of these sorts of off-the-wall, blank-stare, or outer space UNS responses that 
  the translators then become a little more bold and confident about repackaging 
  the discourse both within and beyond the verse, and explicating certain kinds 
  of implicit information within certain parameters.</p>
<p>Using an RSV-like or NIV-like source text, doing a literal translation is real 
  problem. However, starting with a good front translation that is exegetically 
  reliable, that accounts for discourse issues, ordering issues, and implicit-to-explicit 
  issues, a tendency to draft literally can be turned into an asset.</p>
<h3><a name="E"></a>THE PREFERENCE TO WORK FROM A SINGLE SOURCE TEXT:</h3>
<p>Robert Early (Vanuatu) and others have also observed that most MTTs (as well 
  as many OTTs) <i>prefer to draft from a single source text</i>, and do not like 
  to have multiple versions spread out in front of them, even if they can understand 
  them. Our experience in several languages confirms this.<br>
</p>
<p>On a slightly similar tack, we have shown Matt Carlton's TRT in Indonesian 
  to some of our cotranslators. They prefer the system we are using to using that 
  source. Part of the problem in the Timor context with the TRT, perhaps, is <i>it 
  obviously takes training and orientation to be able to use</i>, whereas <i>the 
  Kupang front translation does not</i> (or at least is straightforward enough 
  that MTTs on first encounter can immediately feel &quot;I can do this.&quot; 
  &quot;I can get the hang of this.&quot;). The TRT <i>presents choices</i>, which 
  in our Timor context appears to be undesirable and confusing to the MTTs. If 
  you take some of the choices presented you may actually violate discourse strategies 
  of such things as referent tracking strategies, etc. Their self-confidence in 
  tackling this holy and complex task is such that they not only prefer to draft 
  from a single source text, <i>they do not want to be confronted by choices at 
  the stage of the initial draft.</i> They prefer those options to be brought 
  up and discussed at the next two stages with the whole translation team and 
  a translation advisor-consultant.<br>
</p>
<p>Using an RSV-like or NIV-like source text, translating from a single source 
  text is real problem. However, starting with a good front translation that is 
  exegetically reliable, that accounts for discourse issues, ordering issues, 
  and implicit-to-explicit issues, the preference to translate from a single source 
  text can be turned into an asset.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="F"></a>WHAT MAKES THIS FRONT TRANSLATION USEFUL?<br>
</h3>
<p>Putting these four things together, using the Kupang Malay creole translation 
  as a regional front translation, we have <i>a single source text</i> which has 
  been <i>fully consultant checked</i>, which in its discourse and semantics is 
  <i>structured very closely to the vernaculars</i> in the region and has already 
  identified, incorporated and <i>tested</i>, the kind of discourse repackaging, 
  and implicit-to-explicit issues needed to make a reliable, understandable, natural, 
  and vivid translation acceptable to the churches, and which <i>does not present 
  choices</i> to the MTT drafter working on his/her own. <br>
</p>
<p>So even<i> a highly literal translation</i> into the vernaculars from the Kupang 
  Malay front translation isn't that much of a problem. It gets us <i>very close</i> 
  to where we eventually want to be, and what remains to be done is relatively 
  minor fine-tuning. Contrast that with a draft of any sort from the national 
  language scriptures, which leaves us <i>very far</i> from where we eventually 
  want to be, and what remains to be done is still major repackaging. At the initial 
  drafting stages we actually encourage the MTTs to stick very closely to the 
  Kupang and to make sure every meaning element in the Kupang is accounted for 
  in their vernacular draft. We ask them to flag the draft where they may have 
  added something that is not in the Kupang so we can look at it together.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="G"></a>DOES THIS SPEED UP THE DRAFTING?<br>
</h3>
<p>Timewise, a couple of teams have done their initial draft from the national 
  language Indonesian scriptures before they linked up with us.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">2</a>)</font> 
  One team took 6 months to draft Mark, and one took 6 weeks. Both of them took 
  only 10 days to 2 weeks when they started over from scratch and drafted from 
  the Kupang Malay. Both teams commented enthusiastically on how much easier it 
  is to draft from the Kupang, how much clearer and more natural the product is, 
  and how much greater was their level of confidence in what they drafted.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="H"></a>DOES THIS APPROACH PRODUCE AWKWARD, KUPANG-LOOKING TRANSLATIONS?<br>
</h3>
<p>Because Kupang is structured like the local languages, a literal translation 
  from the Kupang produces drafts in the vernacular that aren't too bad. Then 
  in these vernacular translations that have been drafted from the Kupang, all 
  of the next steps focus on moving it away from the Kupang <i>towards more natural 
  target language</i> rendering, always checking back against the Greek to ensure 
  we have not &quot;lost the plot&quot;. These vernacular translations also go 
  through community checks, back translations, and full verse-by-verse consultant 
  checks. We compile dictionaries and make notes on the grammar to try and account 
  for everything in the book. It has been argued that we might not need back translations 
  here, but that is based on the assumption that the drafters will stick very 
  closely to the Kupang source text. Because they are very churched societies 
  and some know certain passages in the Indonesian scriptures by heart, we cannot 
  make that assumption. The most difficult verses are the ones they have memorised 
  from the problematic Indonesian translation and have often mirrored that in 
  their draft.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="J"></a>THE FRONT TRANSLATION ITSELF GOES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS<br>
</h3>
<p>A<i> feedback and revision</i> process is built into refining the Kupang as 
  a source text. How does this work? In working carefully through the second generation 
  translations, we have occasionally found minor exegetical errors that have been 
  overlooked in the Kupang consultant check, and trace back to that as the source 
  text. <br>
</p>
<p>More importantly, there were several verses that proved to be consistently 
  awkward to translate from the Kupang into several of the local vernaculars. 
  The Kupang wasn't wrong or unnatural in those verses, just unhelpful as a source 
  text. When we found a satisfactory solution in one or more vernaculars we then 
  went back to see if that particular information packaging could be mirrored 
  in a revision of the Kupang, subsequently making it more useful as a front translation. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Each of these &quot;tweaks&quot; are fully discussed with at least one member 
  of the Kupang translation team, are processed by a qualified translation consultant, 
  and are duly reported to the Branch translation department for the record, even 
  though these are not SIL-owned translations. We are currently distributing the 
  third edition of Kupang Mark for translators to use as a front translation. 
  When the whole NT is published, it is the revised and improved version that 
  will go into it.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="K"></a>WHAT ELSE HAVE WE COME TO UNDERSTAND CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUCCESS 
  OF THE KUPANG FRONT TRANSLATION?</h3>
<p><b>1. Deliberate choices are taken to make the Kupang more useful as a front 
  translation</b><br>
</p>
<p><i>Because it will be used as a front translation</i>, deliberate choices are 
  made in translating new books of the Kupang scriptures How so? Experienced translators 
  are aware that there are often several acceptable ways of rendering a verse 
  (compare all the English translations, for example). By being a Malay-based 
  creole, we often have the option of using a more compact technical term, abstract 
  noun, or Indonesian religious term that is fully entrenched in the churches 
  (albeit not very well understood). All but one of our cotranslators on the Kupang 
  team are also fluent in one or more of the surrounding vernaculars. Where we 
  are considering alternate renderings, particularly more packed versus more unpacked 
  renderings, we stop and ask the question, &quot;Which approach maps more transparently 
  into the vernaculars?&quot; Everybody tries them on for size with their vernacular(s), 
  and it usually becomes immediately obvious which rendering will make the Kupang 
  more useful as a front translation. <br>
</p>
<p>This is a deliberate strategy. In one language (Helong) we find almost a word-for-word 
  correlation with whole paragraphs of the Kupang Malay. While this appears highly 
  suspicious, it is supported by a corpus of recorded and transcribed natural 
  text in Helong. And Helong is the traditional kingship around which the city 
  of Kupang grew and the creole developed.<br>
</p>
<p><b>2. Request from church leaders for uniformity in exegetical choices across 
  translations in their region</b><br>
</p>
<p>The synod leaders in Kupang (their synod encompasses an area speaking around 
  50 languages, with 1800 congregations) have requested that translations in the 
  various vernaculars <i>not vary greatly in their exegetical choices</i>. They 
  know that many of their members are multilingual and do not want them comparing 
  Bibles and finding things going off in radically different directions.<i> they 
  want a high degree of conformity</i> in the translations done in their region. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>This does not happen in the normal way of isolated translation teams each making 
  their own exegetical choices without reference to how it has been handled in 
  neighbouring languages. <i>It can happen</i> if all the teams in a region work 
  with reference to a high quality front translation in which senior local church 
  leaders have had a role in making the exegetical choices that went into it. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>We are facing a potentially awkward situation in which there is one translation 
  team working within this synod's area, but not working under the umbrella of 
  the church, and perhaps making different exegetical choices from the Kupang, 
  and not following the overall Kupang style and pattern. This seemingly innocuous 
  issue could be a key as to whether or not their in-isolation translation is 
  acceptable to the church, and thus to the society for which they are doing the 
  translation.<br>
</p>
<p><b>3. Where possible, we follow the exegetical choices in the national language 
  Bible commonly used in churches</b><br>
</p>
<p>In general, <i>we try to stick with the exegetical choices made by the Indonesian 
  TB</i>, where there is not a compelling reason to go in another direction, <i>if 
  </i>the TB has made an exegetical choice that is supportable in the context 
  and by good commentaries. In practice we diverge from it a lot, which tells 
  you about the over-all quality of the TB, but we do not deliberately diverge 
  from it just because other options are available.<br>
</p>
<p>In fact, at a recent consultant check, the translation consultant pointed out 
  that another exegesis was more consistent with the themes of the surrounding 
  passage and &quot;encouraged&quot; the team to change to the stronger choice. 
  However, this was a very well known passage in church circles and the weaker 
  exegesis is the one known in Indonesian church and theology circles. The two 
  choices lead to significantly different translations of the passage. We discussed 
  it thoroughly with the MTT's. They agreed the interpretation they were familiar 
  with was the weaker choice once the passage was reconsidered in light of the 
  context, but since it was supportable and consistent with the interpretation 
  Indonesians traditionally apply to that passage, they wanted to stick with the 
  weaker exegesis. The consultant was fortunately of broad enough experience to 
  realise that compromise, local ownership, the end-user, and the momentum of 
  the existing church, are all legitimate issues that effect translations, and 
  while it may not be &quot;best&quot;, or even pleasing, it is not &quot;wrong&quot;, 
  and it is supportable.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Acc"></a>ACCEPTABILITY OF THE KUPANG AND TRANSLATIONS BASED ON IT<br>
</h3>
<p>On the &quot;fourth dimension of translation&quot; regarding <i>acceptability</i>, 
  these translations around Timor are commissioned, owned and used by the local 
  churches (not by SIL). Our unit at the university that does the translations 
  is the technical arm formally commissioned with implementing Bible translation 
  for the churches. The head of a denomination that has 1800 congregations and 
  over 1.2 million members puts a forward in the published portions in all the 
  languages. Sales continue to climb. In addition to ever-widening use in churches, 
  audio versions are starting to be broadcast on the radio. The governor has instructed 
  the department of education to place &quot;The Joseph Story&quot; in the public 
  schools as part of the locally developed curriculum materials.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">3</a>)</font> 
  I could go on and on. Under this dynamic, we (meaning our Timorese cotranslators, 
  Timorese administrator, Timorese leaders, and 2 ex-pat SIL-trained families 
  seconded to the Christian university, plus one retired SIL translation consultant) 
  are currently active in 16 languages, with requests/instructions to begin in 
  five more. The president of the university has announced he expects us to be 
  actively involved in 40 languages within two years. Among our cotranslators 
  are those with MAs and PhDs in theology, anthropology, and linguistics, as well 
  as farmers, school teachers, and fishermen. We have World Christians who were 
  delegates at the first Lausanne Conference on World Evangelism, and those who 
  interact with churches, human rights organisations, and development organisations 
  at a national and international level. They are not all living in isolated villages 
  in the remote rainforest, carrying spears and wearing loincloths. <br>
</p>
<p>Both the current and anticipated involvement in translation in so many languages 
  with such a limited number of trainer-adviser-consultants are <i>only possible 
  because of the use of the Kupang front translation</i>.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="L"></a>THE KUPANG FRONT TRANSLATION IS SHOWING ITSELF USEFUL BEYOND 
  THE KUPANG SPEAKING AREA<br>
</h3>
<p>The Kupang translation is being used as a front translation or source text 
  <i>beyond our region</i>. Because Kupang Malay is a Malay-based creole, it shares 
  many features with <i>other Malay-based creoles</i> in eastern Indonesia. Some 
  of these shared features are well documented in the linguistic and Malay literature. 
  So people working with Ambonese Malay, Manado Malay, and Aru Malay are finding 
  that the Kupang Malay scriptures are much easier for them to utilise as source 
  texts than are the Indonesian scriptures. Again, it is the discourse repackaging, 
  unpacking dense theological terms, etc. that make it useful. They need our Kupang 
  Malay <i>dictionary</i> to follow some of the lexical items and gramatical functors, 
  but several have reported that the KM scriptures are extremely helpful to them. 
  One person working over 1,000 kilometres away said, &quot;the Kupang scriptures 
  are the single most useful translation resource for my team&quot;. I have run 
  discourse workshops in Maluku and Irian Jaya (Papua), and know that many of 
  the discourse packaging patterns of how background information is handled, how 
  referents are tracked, how one indicates shifts in time or events, and how certain 
  logical relationships are indicated are shared with languages far beyond where 
  Kupang Malay is spoken. <br>
</p>
<p>In <i>East Timor</i>, the Tetun Dili (a Tetun-based creole) translation team 
  also found it significantly easier to model their translation on the Kupang 
  as its primary source than to use either the Indonesian or the Portuguese scriptures. 
  The main drafter had not lived in Kupang and needed the assistance of the dictionary. 
  We anticipate this Tetun Dili translation may, in turn, serve as <i>a front 
  translation for other vernacular translations in East Timor</i>. <br>
</p>
<p>On the island of Rote there is a chain of related language/dialects that, for 
  linguistic and sociolinguistic reasons, are unwilling to use or accommodate 
  to other varieties. Our strongest and most experienced translation team is in 
  the central Termanu variety and so we have prioritised that as going ahead, 
  with the intent that it can be used as <i>a more localised front translation</i> 
  on Rote. Also we envisioned that the other varieties can triangulate with the 
  Kupang and the Termanu as two very similar front translations. In actual practice, 
  however, the teams know Kupang better than they know other varieties of Rote, 
  so they are preferring to use just the Kupang. Perhaps this is related to Robert 
  Early's observation of preferring only one source text.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="M"></a>ARE FRONT TRANSLATIONS USEFUL ONLY IF THEY ARE CUSTOMIZED 
  TO THE REGION?<br>
</h3>
<p>Now to some broader issues. I initially saw that what we were weaving into 
  the Kupang translation that was making it useful as a front translation were 
  things like: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> packaging the discourse the way languages in the region package their discourse, 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> unpacking dense theological terms, abstract nouns, and passives,<br>
  </li>
  <li> using local idioms, semantic categories, and lexical choices and collocations 
    to make the translation vivid. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>So I initially thought that <i>what was useful about the notion of front translations 
  was that they were customised for regional issues</i>. I initially did not see 
  how a standard or universal front translation could be done in a way that was 
  useful, or could be useful to us in Timor.<br>
</p>
<p><i>I now think differently and believe there is a legitimate place and urgent 
  need for a standard or universal front translation.</i> Why? Because we have 
  had some of our Timorese cotranslators themselves approach us and ask to draft 
  directly from the English NLT or CEV, rather than from the hastily translated 
  Indonesian BIS (mirrored on the TEV). Why not just do the initial draft straight 
  from the CEV or NLT, if they are able? I agree. Among our 45 or so cotranslators 
  in 16 languages, I believe we have 6-8 individuals who are perfectly capable 
  of drafting from the English translations. And I believe the world has changed 
  such that there are many regions of the world in which a portion of the pool 
  of possible cotranslators are those who can handle English in this way. Not 
  everyone and not everywhere, but some.<br>
</p>
<p><b>1. Why not just use the CEV or NLT as a standard front translation?</b><br>
</p>
<p>A good draft from the NLT or CEV is a good start, but is still not getting 
  us where we need to be for the Kupang or other vernaculars in our region. Why 
  not? Because:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> the NLT or CEV are still often too timid to repackage the discourse to 
    get the background and foreground information laid out right, <br>
  </li>
  <li> they are still too content with using dense religious terms and abstract 
    nouns, <br>
  </li>
  <li> they do not explicate legitimate information that was known and assumed 
    by the original audience without teaching, but cannot be known bythe Timorese 
    audience without explication or teaching. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>So I am saying the NLT and CEV are very useful, but <i>do not go far enough 
  to fill our needs for a front translation</i>.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">4</a>)</font><br>
</p>
<p>For the moment, some of these lacks are supplemented by the MTT drafters of 
  Kupang looking at Kathy Taber's English back translations of the Luang scriptures, 
  at Chuck &amp; Barbara Grimes' English back translations of the Buru scriptures 
  (related languages in the region that handle the discourse correctly), and looking 
  at Translator's Notes on TW3.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">5</a>)</font></p>
<p><b>2. Why a standard front translation could be useful</b></p>
<p>Above I noted that, &quot;I initially saw that what we were weaving into the 
  Kupang translation that was making it useful as a front translation were things 
  like: 1) packaging the discourse the way languages in the region package their 
  discourse, 2) unpacking dense theological terms and abstract nouns, 3) using 
  local idioms, semantic categories, and lexical choices and collocations to make 
  the translation vivid.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p><i>I now understand this differently</i>. Under category (1) above, I believe 
  it more accurately divides up into:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1a) universal or near-universal discourse patterns of information packaging, 
    and <br>
  </p>
  <p>(1b) regionally specific discourse patterns. Certain things in category (1a) 
    might be just as relevant and helpful in Latin American languages as they 
    are with Austronesian, Papuan, or Australian Aboriginal languages. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to category (2) I note that we are finding the Hawaii Pidgin NT 
  &quot;<i>Da Jesus Book</i>&quot; extremely helpful for how to render some difficult 
  verses in the epistles. There seem to be some shared ways that creole languages 
  need to unpack things if they are to avoid meaningless religious terminology 
  and unpack abstract nouns. This on-the-surface rendering is then relatively 
  easy to find ways to translate in the other vernaculars.6 </p>
<p>So these are two areas at least where a good front translation could be broadly 
  useful around the world. I now believe:</p>
<ol>
  <li> in the changing world there are a few potential cotranslators around the 
    world who are capable of handling a good English front translation; <br>
  </li>
  <li> CEV and NLT, while mostly good, aren't sufficient for what we need to produce 
    good vernacular translations in unchurched, or semi-churched societies, many 
    of whom are effectively<i> churched without a Bible</i> because many national 
    language scriptures used in many churches around the world are <i>not good 
    translations</i>,<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">7</a>)</font> and the over-all 
    <i>proficiency</i> of many believers in the national language is <i>not sufficient 
    to become a mature believer equipped for life and ministry</i>; <br>
  </li>
  <li> there is a practical need for a standard source translation or a universal 
    front translation or whatever you want to call it for:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>that minority of MTTs who can handle the English to draft from directly 
        anywhere in the world, <br>
      </li>
      <li> as a base for other front translations in world languages (e.g. good 
        front translations in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, French, Arabic, Standard 
        Malay, and Mandarin could turn loose MTTs in a <i>huge</i> number of vernacular 
        translations that cannot make good drafts from the national language scriptures 
        currently used in churches), <br>
      </li>
      <li> regional-language front translations within large countries (e.g. Brasilian 
        Portuguese creoles spoken around the Amazon basin, Malay-based creoles 
        in Indonesia, Hiri Motu in PNG, backwoods Spanish creoles spoken in Mexico, 
        the Carribean, and the rest of Latin America, west African French(?), 
        East African English (?), Moroccon Arabic, etc.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>I highly commend Robert Early's excellent &quot;Case study: Bislama creole 
  front translaton on Epi Island, Vanuatu&quot; which really needs to be published. 
  Also useful for gaining perspective on the need for front translations is Ellis 
  Deibler's &quot;Front Translations: a proposed help for MTTs&quot;.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">8</a>)</font></p>
<h3><a name="N"></a>WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO PRODUCE A GOOD STANDARD FRONT TRANSLATION?</h3>
<p>Extracting the text from Translator's Notes is perhaps a good place to start. 
  However, there are additional things that need to be done to make even that 
  really useful as a front translation, and one would need a team of people with 
  broad experience as a translators and translation consultants to be able to 
  do that well. There needs to be some good thinking into <i>the process</i> and 
  what <i>checks and balances</i> are needed to constrain the parameters.<br>
</p>
<p>To lead the team you need someone with the vision, the experience, the expertise, 
  and the commitment for it. It is hard to find the right &quot;champion&quot; 
  for projects of this sort. <br>
</p>
<p><i>I feel this idea of a front translation is potentially a key to whether 
  or not Vision 2025 is reachable or not.</i> Without something like this to open 
  new possibilities and new ways of doing things, I have my reservations as to 
  whether V2025 is achievable. John Watters' keeps reiterating that it's not going 
  to happen if we keep doing it as we have always done it.</p>
<p><b>1. How it is presented to churches, translators, and translation organisations 
  is critical</b></p>
<p>How one represents, packages and promotes the idea of a front translation is 
  critical. Done wrongly, all of the self-proclaimed translation experts around 
  the world (in SIL, the Bible Societies, and seminaries), no matter how poorly 
  informed on the issue, are very likely to proclaim how ridiculous and presumptuous 
  it is to usurp the Greek text and provide another text to use as a primary source 
  for MTTs to draft from. They will nit-pick it to death and argue endlessly about 
  irrelevant genealogies (to paraphrase Titus). The team that works on it must 
  be prepared to be vulnerable and abused by less-than-fully-informed experts. 
  (See the nonsense on both extremes of the inclusive-language debate as an example 
  of what kinds of uninformed idiocies can be put forth on these sorts of issues.) 
</p>
<p>I predict many people would initially be offended by the idea, even though 
  practically speaking many of them already push the use of the TEV and CEV as 
  a substitute source text in place of the Greek, in spite of the known short-comings 
  of those translations.</p>
<p>A standard front translation of this sort probably needs to be packaged and 
  promoted carefully <i>as a resource for translators</i>, not as a substitute 
  for the Greek text, nor as an authoritative translation on its own. </p>
<p><b>2. It might be useful to do two &quot;standard front translations&quot;</b></p>
<p><i>One should be more conservative</i>, within range of what is acceptable 
  by some consultants who don't feel comfortable with legitimate higher level 
  discourse repackaging and explicating legitimate information that we have collectively 
  demonstrated widely that UNSs can't get the logic or sequence or point of the 
  passage without. I predict that the more conservative front translation would 
  be favoured by many new translators who haven't gotten deeply into the language 
  and haven't done much community testing with true UNSs.</p>
<p><i>One should be a more &quot;radical&quot; front translation</i> to do it 
  right based on our collective experience of why conservative, tight, and formal 
  translations do not communicate successfully in many societies. I would recommend 
  doing them quickly, and then planning for refined editions of each of them as 
  we gain experience using them in various regions and get feedback about what 
  works, what doesn't, and what might be more useful renderings. I predict this 
  more radical front translation would be favoured by experienced translators 
  who are deeply into the language and have gotten extensive community feedback.</p>
<p>While the experts strut and argue and condemn, meanwhile a whole bunch of MTTs 
  around the world using such a front translation might be able to start making 
  some very good drafts of scripture in their languages with very little training, 
  which they have never been able to do from either the Greek text nor from their 
  national language scriptures. </p>
<p>It seems to me this kind of <i>empowering of local translators</i> is something 
  we have been praying towards, something that we should rejoice in the possibility 
  of, and something in which we <i>should be willing to risk failure and a few 
  false starts along the way to fine-tune into a useful translation resource.</i></p>
<h3><a name="O"></a>HAS THE SINGLE SOURCE TEXT APPROACH BEEN USED ANYWHERE?</h3>
<p>Let's speak honestly (which in this case means in a way that may not be politically 
  correct). The single source text or front translation approach has been and 
  continues to be widely used around the world, for example, when Bible translation 
  agencies or consultants push the TEV (now shifting to the CEV) or national language 
  equivalent, as <i>the</i> source for MTTs. The inadequacy of that for our needs 
  is addressed above. </p>
<p>I say this [2 paragraphs of examples cut] to illustrate, on the basis of what 
  we already know, <i>how destructive using an inadequate source text and taking 
  short-cuts can be for getting God's Word into the hands and hearts of people 
  in the kingdom.</i> A bad translation shackles the body of Christ in a region 
  for generations, and in some cases, for centuries. Ignorance, arrogance, and 
  a lack of good promotion often prevent a bad translation being superceded by 
  a good one.</p>
<h3><a name="P"></a>IF MTTS USE A FRONT TRANSLATION AND ARE NOT MAKING THEIR OWN 
  EXEGETICAL DECISIONS, AREN'T WE VIOLATING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GOOD TRAINING, 
  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CAPACITY BUILDING?</h3>
<p>Just so I wouldn't spoonfeed my prior prejudices on this question, I gathered 
  together the following people to discuss the issue:</p>
<ul>
  <li> myself; (translation trainer/adviser/consultant, linguistics consultant, 
    scripture use consultant)</li>
  <li> Timor MTT who is also a senior church leader in Timor with 40 years in 
    ministry, and a translation advisor on 4 other languages;</li>
  <li> Timor MTT who has taken full SIL courses, and is completing an MA in Bilingual 
    Education in Australia;</li>
  <li> Translation Trainer/Advisor, who is also an SIL International Anthro Consultant, 
    and is certified by AusAid as a consultant in community development, gender 
    issues, and anthropology (so she deals with these issues of paternalism, capacity 
    building, sustainable development, and problems of spoonfeeding at a professional 
    level);</li>
  <li> retired translator with over 30 years of working with aboriginal communities 
    in Australia, including several years in adult education with a govt. agency, 
    who is also a Translation Consultant with experience checking books in 6 countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The criticism of front translations spoonfeeding exegetical choices, and not 
  building capacity and independence in the long-run both has a point and misses 
  the point.</p>
<p><b>1. Good translation requires dependence and inter-dependence, not independence</b></p>
<p>Taken at face value, nobody meets the ideal of competence and independence, 
  whether expat or MTT, set out by one critic of using front translations. To 
  do so would require an individual to have a PhD in linguistics, a PhD in translation 
  <i>and</i> a PhD in Biblical Studies, or their equivalents, plus a couple of 
  lifetimes of experience to have the perspective and wisdom to evaluate and put 
  to use the knowledge one has in these fields. Even most senior translation consultants 
  in the Bible Societies and SIL do not work at the level of competence and independence 
  implied as ideal by one critic. </p>
<p>Most of us are willing to acknowledge that the <i>teams</i> of scholar/experts 
  who produced the NIV, RSV, NLT, Translator's Handbooks, SSA's, and Exegetical 
  Summaries, for example, collectively know more than any one of us possibly could. 
  We are willing to trust that knowledge, and use those as translation resources. 
  <i>The front translation concept is another kind of translation help</i>, that 
  takes into account information packaging issues that are relevant to the target 
  language and situation, but that have not been considered by these major language 
  translations. </p>
<p>Some expat translators interact directly with the Greek text, as do some MTT 
  translators. Some only interact <i>indirectly</i> with the Greek text. Do we 
  have a dual standard that expat translators can use helps and be dependent on 
  a larger team and supporting infrastructure, but MTTs must be fully competent 
  and independent? Of course not!<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">9</a>)</font></p>
<p>The ideal may be commendable, but it is unrealistic in any context that we 
  can think of. The point is: <i>we are all dependent in many areas</i>. And we 
  are dependent and independent at different levels and in different areas. That 
  is why we work in teams beyond just the local language team, with each member 
  having different roles and strengths. And there are procedural checks to ensure 
  the important things are covered and there is accountability in producing the 
  Word of God. Every resource made available to us on Translator's Workplace is 
  built on the understanding that nobody is capable of working fully independently, 
  and certain people know more than others in specialised areas, and thus are 
  made available to assist us in the task. </p>
<p>The Front Translations are also of this sort: they are helps designed to be 
  especially useful to MTTs who have limited access to the original Greek or Hebrew 
  text, and to other resources, background and training, but who have a vision 
  and commitment to see God's Word in their language.</p>
<p><b>2. MTTs often have very limited access to very limited resources</b></p>
<p>To equip &quot;nationals&quot; to be competent exegetes is a worthy goal. But 
  it is perhaps more realistic to first think of building capacity within whole 
  systems, such as denominations, Bible schools, Christian universities and seminaries, 
  before investing heavily in targetting small isolated and &quot;backwards&quot; 
  language communities who may not have the educational, cultural, logistic base 
  or motivation to participate in our goals superimposed on them. </p>
<p>One very practical issue we face in Indonesia is extremely limited written 
  resources for both training and using in translation. From a professional point 
  of view, the Indonesian Bible translations are inadequate, insufficient, and 
  unsatisfactory as source texts. Until recently, almost everything that was written 
  was in a high formal register of Indonesian not understood by poorly educated 
  (=anything below university graduate) MTTs in rural parts of Indonesia. Almost 
  no commentaries were available. There is still no Greek-Indonesian Interlinear 
  available. The available Greek-Indonesian dictionary is a translation of Barclay 
  Newman's student glossary, not a full-blown lexicon that gives the kind of sense 
  and context discrimination we need for Bible translation. So <i>direct access 
  to the source texts is extremely limited. </i></p>
<p>SIL and the Indonesian Bible Society are cooperating on translating the UBS 
  Translator's Handbook series into Indonesian. But it takes time (literally years), 
  and aiming it at a popular level of Indonesian that might be understood by most 
  MTTs is objectionable to some of the learned people who review them before printing, 
  along with other challenges that arise in producing something that is actually 
  useful to MTTs. <br>
</p>
<p>The Indonesian NBTO is focused on training OTTs, not MTTs, and more in literacy 
  and community development than in translation. No serious course in Bible translation 
  principles and practices has yet been developed or offered in Indonesian. So 
  without exegetical resources in a language they can understand, and extensive 
  training how to use them, <i>how do you empower MTTs to do good translation?</i> 
  Most formal theological training in Indonesia is not equipping people with the 
  kinds of knowledge and skills in exegesis, Biblical Studies, and Biblical languages 
  most useful for Bible translation.</p>
<p><b>3. Does every MTT have to be fully competent, or just certain people in 
  the system?</b></p>
<p>There is the question of how isolated or integrated is the infrastructure under 
  which you are operating, and what are your ultimate goals. </p>
<p><i>a. When we teach Greek at seminaries, do we expect every student to become 
  a Greek scholar?</i></p>
<p>For a parallel example, whether in Timor, or Australia, or the US, many Bible 
  Schools teach Koine Greek as if they are trying to produce competent Greek scholars. 
  In querying some Bible schools and seminaries on why they approach teaching 
  Greek in such a difficult, demoralising and irrelevant traditional way, and 
  how many of their students have gone on to actually become competent Greek scholars, 
  the numbers consistently come back as less than one percent going on to become 
  competent Greek scholars (one Bible school in Australia admitted in 11 years 
  of graduating classes, only one student had continued on to become a Greek scholar 
  of any sort). The Greek course I teach on Timor is designed (using Dobson's 
  textbook<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">10</a>)</font> which I have permission 
  to adapt for an Indonesian audience), not to produce Greek scholars, but to 
  equip people whose vision is for congregational ministry to be competent to 
  handle Greek resources that they have access to. Both staff and students have 
  commented on how much enthusiasm there is in my Greek courses, and on how much 
  Greek the students actually learned, without getting demoralised. So I have 
  redesigned the course to be more consistent with the ultimate purposes of the 
  seminary. Am I limiting their capacity for Greek? No! I think I am actually 
  increasing it, and the students and staff think the same. The seminary and the 
  synods we interact with have a few people who are reasonably competent in Greek 
  and Hebrew. Nobody feels it is realistic to expect that <i>all</i> theology 
  students should be professionally competent in Greek and Hebrew, when the primary 
  goal for both trainers and trainees is to equip them for ministry to rural congregations.</p>
<p><i>b. In Timor, senior church leaders are involved in the exegetical choices 
  that go into the front translation</i></p>
<p>In the context of Bible translation in Timor, the exegetical options are discussed 
  <i>thoroughly</i> with senior church leaders (and anyone else) who are on the 
  Kupang translation team. Many of them have also read (in English or in Indonesian) 
  Fee and Stuart's text on exegesis,<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">11</a>)</font> 
  in addition to whatever they got in their theology training.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">12</a>)</font> 
  We look at AGNT, multiple translations in Indonesian and English,<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">13</a>)</font> 
  Exegetical Summaries, Translator's Handbooks, Translator's Notes, SSA's, TBT, 
  NOT, and other resources <i>together</i>, discuss the relevant options, and 
  seek the most appropriate solution <i>together</i>. One or more of us will have 
  to defend these choices to groups of UNS's, to other church leaders, and to 
  a translation consultant, so the more people who understand how we got there, 
  the better for everyone.</p>
<p><b>4. Why not just follow the exegetical choices of the national language Bible?</b></p>
<p>Why don't we just follow the exegetical choices of the Indonesian Bible? The 
  reasons are complex, but I'll try to make it brief. The BIS translation is a 
  hasty translation of the TEV. Its Indonesian syntax is relatively good, and 
  the vocabulary choice is significantly clearer than the TB translation, but 
  they have added problems onto the TEV base, and in some books there may be as 
  many as 5 exegetical errors per page (as in parts of Genesis). Furthermore, 
  the <i>BIS has not been accepted widely for use in Indonesian churches</i>, 
  so nobody will object if we do not follow the BIS. </p>
<p>The TB is another matter. It is widely used in Indonesian churches, even though 
  one has to have grown up in a church tradition to have a hope of really understanding 
  it. This is the translation that people have memorised from, and that is exclusively 
  seen as &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; in churches and seminaries. The syntax is 
  often not Indonesian SVO (instead, often mirroring Greek VSO syntax), the vocabulary 
  is more than obscure and archaic than the BIS (e.g. in the OT often preserving 
  the Hebrew names of flora and fauna, or maintaining high register vocabulary 
  from literary classical Malay not understood by anyone), and sociolinguistically 
  I refer to it in published papers as &quot;High Church Malay&quot; rather than 
  Indonesian.<font size="-1">(<a href="#1">14</a>)</font> The TB, in both the 
  translations that it builds on and its philosophy and principles of translation 
  places itself squarely in the 1800s (in spite of its post-WW2 publishing date). 
  It was worked on by moderately and highly trained theologians who wanted it 
  to be acceptable to other highly trained theologians, with no concessions made 
  to your average minister of the gospel being able to understand it, much less 
  your average church member (and certainly not those in rural areas of eastern 
  Indonesia). So it does not incorporate anything that we have learned about Bible 
  translation in the past 60 years, which is considerable. </p>
<p><i>a. A poor national language translation limits the ability of MTTs to do 
  good exegesis, and thus, good translation</i></p>
<p>Fee and Stuart point out that the <i>basic tool for good exegesis is A GOOD 
  TRANSLATION</i>. In the Timor and Indonesian contexts, such a translation does 
  not exist. We provide it for MTT teams around Timor through the Kupang front 
  translation. The Kupang front translation empowers MTTs to do translation in 
  their vernaculars that is better and more communicative than the national language 
  scriptures. I know this is a bold statement, and we (both expats and MTTs) are 
  happy to defend it. It is important for outsiders to understand that the Indonesian 
  scriptures are <i>a significant limiting factor in training and empowering MTTs</i> 
  in Indonesia, and a limiting factor in the Indonesian church. And there are 
  many parallels around the world.</p>
<p><i>b. Targetting the everyday language of the common people makes our translations 
  look significantly different from many national language translations that aim 
  to please the theologians, or that are shackled in literary and religious traditions</i></p>
<p>Simply gearing our Timor translations to be clearly understood in the language 
  of the common people means <i>our translations fundamentally and radically look 
  and feel different from the TB translation.</i> And looking different from what 
  is considered &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; in a churched society immediately sets 
  these translations up for rejection <i>unless there are compensating factors.</i></p>
<p><i>c. What compensating factors can overcome the national language scriptures 
  being seen exclusively as &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;?</i></p>
<p>No matter how inadequate the Indonesian Bible is from a translation perspective, 
  in church contexts the TB is the &quot;Holy Bible&quot;, and anything that differs 
  from it will be severely and publicly criticised. That is a given. So we are 
  realising in Kupang it has been essential to have:</p>
<ol>
  <li> an excellent and vivid translation that is clearly understood in the language 
    of the common people, </li>
  <li> that is at the same time a scholarly translation defendable at every verse, 
  </li>
  <li> that has more study aids (e.g. cross references, parallel passages, footnotes, 
    maps, pictures) than the national language scriptures, </li>
  <li> that has the direct involvement of recognised senior church leaders, </li>
  <li> and that is officially commissioned and blessed by the dominant church 
    in the area. </li>
</ol>
<p>God put these things together in the Timor region, not all by our deliberate 
  design, and we recognise they are all important elements. It is the assessment 
  of some of our cotranslators that the Kupang translation (the one used as a 
  front translation) is a superior translation to the Indonesian scriptures. This 
  is absolutely essential to it being used as a front translation, and for it 
  to even have a hope of being accepted in the churches. Remember, Kupang is a 
  Malay-based creole, a stygmatised language initially and intuitively seen as 
  &quot;bad Indonesian&quot; by most people in government, education and the church. 
  (Historically and linguistically an incorrect view, but nevertheless the view 
  of uninformed power-brokers.)</p>
<p><b>5. Most local language translation teams do not <i>want</i> to do their 
  own exegesis, if senior church leaders have done the exegesis of the front translation</b></p>
<p>Now back to the topic at hand. <i>Because</i> respected senior church leaders 
  (some retired) are involved in the Kupang front translation, and because they 
  are fully involved in the exegetical discussions and choices, and because these 
  translations are commissioned and owned by the synod, the teams using the Kupang 
  as a front translation <i>do not want</i> to change or challenge the exegetical 
  choices made in the Kupang translation. They <i>want</i> to follow it. This 
  is true even with cotranslators who are seminary lecturers, and some with Masters 
  degrees and PhD's in theology. </p>
<p>Every team has at least someone who knows the TB so well they invariably raise 
  questions about why the Kupang diverges from the TB on certain verses. We always 
  take them back to the Greek (not to the Kupang, nor to the Indonesian) to discuss 
  the why's. </p>
<p>In the Tetun Dili translation in East Timor, we actually did an additional 
  pass with church leaders from six denominations to walk them through and get 
  them involved in the exegetical issues, and help them gain confidence and ownership 
  in the exegesis, as well as to get them familiar with the rest of the translation 
  process. </p>
<p>So the way we work in Timor, <i>senior church leaders are involved directly 
  in the exegetical decisions of the front translation. </i>The local church (in 
  the larger sense) has involvement and ownership, and the individual language 
  teams <i>do not want</i> to forge their own path, do not have the <i>time</i> 
  to do so (most of them have full time jobs as teachers, pastors, farmers, or 
  government officials), nor the <i>interest</i> to become experts who are fully 
  equipped to make mature decisions about exegesis on their own. </p>
<p>Any queries they raise about exegesis are discussed thoroughly and openly on 
  the spot with reference to the Greek text and its meaning. We do not avoid exegetical 
  discussions. But<i> using the Kupang as a front translation streamlines and 
  focuses the discussion.</i> By using the front translation, and dealing with 
  exegetical questions raised by the MTT's we are not bogging down in the mire 
  of discussing issues that may not be relevant or of interest to them. Whether 
  they have theological training or not, they invariably comment on learning new 
  things, not only about exegesis, but about Biblical culture and history, and 
  about the point of the passage. It is a poor training strategy in a complex 
  task that insists on dumping everything on them at once, regardless of how relevant 
  it is to the question at hand. We have all experienced information overload. 
  Again, the front translation helps us stay focused, and we address exegetical 
  issues as they arise naturally.</p>
<p><b>6. Where the national language Bible used in churches is exegetically reliable, 
  it would be wise to follow its choices, if scripture use is an important goal</b></p>
<p>So in the Indonesian context, neither of the national language translations 
  is broadly transparent or even good as a source for consistently following its 
  exegetical choices. If the TB isn't problematic on a particular verse, we lean 
  towards following its choices where we can, but its obscurity usually makes 
  a moot point of the issue. In the PNG context, my understanding of the Tok Pisin 
  translation is that, while many expat translators see room for improvement, 
  it is not a &quot;bad&quot; translation in the way that the Indonesian translations 
  are. It was done in the 60s and 70s by some good people in Madang and Moresby(?), 
  who were aware of modern translation principles and applied them. So I assume 
  the decision to follow the exegetical choices of the Tok Pisin Bible for the 
  north coast front translation is a reasonable one, based on the assumption that 
  the Tok Pisin Bible is somewhere in the ballpark of what is an acceptable translation 
  from a translation perspective. &quot;Somewhere in the ballpark&quot;, does 
  not require that it be pleasing to everyone on all counts or all passages (show 
  me an English translation that does), but that it follows sound translation 
  principles, communicates clearly, follows supportable exegetical options, and 
  in this context is acceptable to the churches of PNG. If not, at around 30 years 
  old, perhaps it is time to revise the Tok Pisin Bible.</p>
<p>So it seems to those of us who discussed it here in Darwin, that the issues 
  of having exegetical consistency across translations in a region, combined with 
  acceptability to the churches, and the goal of having scriptures that are used, 
  are prior issues to the ideal of training every translator to be a competent 
  and independent exegete.</p>
<p><b>7. Building a pool of competent exegetes could take more than a generation. 
  As we work towards that, we can be providing their entire society with the basic 
  tool of good exegesis&#151;a good translation. Using the front translation approach, 
  the society itself can have maximum involvement and ownership in that task.</b></p>
<p>In the context of the Australian Aborigines, 30-40 years ago people were saying 
  &quot;teach them English so they can participate fully in the mainstream as 
  equals&quot;. 40 years later, with the best efforts of the government services 
  and systems, church programs, and the educational system involving some very 
  good people, people are still saying the same thing. In the meantime, some communities 
  have gotten an orthography, a body of vernacular reading materials, dictionaries, 
  and vernacular Bibles or New Testaments, with segments of these communities 
  becoming literate in their own language because of those efforts. It is one 
  or more steps along the path toward &quot;development&quot; (as defined by developed 
  societies), which makes these communities better off than those who don't have 
  even that, and more equipped to participate (partially or fully) in the mainstream 
  of white Australian society. Despite some very commendable efforts by Batchelor 
  College (government), Nungalinya College (church), and SIL's community-empowering 
  Certificate in Translation program, Australia probably has not yet been able 
  to produce an average of one person in each language community who is ready 
  to be trained to function competently and independently as an exegete at the 
  level implied by the critic of front translations. </p>
<p>But then, realistically, you actually have to train a pool of people per language 
  community, because there are the practical issues of health, politics, family 
  obligations, and the competent people being swept up by government and private 
  industry at better salaries than any translation organisation or church can 
  afford, which takes people out of the loop. Producing fully competent and independent 
  exegetes could take generations. That is not paternalistic, it is realistic.</p>
<p>In a complex task, we start where people are, and we build their capacity in 
  different aspects of the task, working with and compensating for cultural and 
  educational limitations, inadequate written resources, time constraints, and 
  the wishes of the community. It is called &quot;partnership&quot;. It is called 
  &quot;teamwork&quot;. It is called &quot;the body of Christ&quot;. </p>
<p>So if you are wanting to experiment with the front translation approach, go 
  for it! Do it with excellence. Just make sure the local churches are on board.</p>

  neighbouring languages were translating, or because they did this <i>before</i> 
  we caught on to the idea of using the Kupang as a front translation.<br>

<p><a name="1"></a><font color="#FF0000" size="-1">(4)</font>  David Crawford, Director of AAIG, also says NLT and CEV do not go far enough 
  in laying things out in ways that are useful to Aboriginal MTT translators to 
  make a decent draft on their own. He says a good front translation would be 
  a useful resource in Australia.<br>

<p><a name="1"></a><font color="#FF0000" size="-1">(6)</font> For the record, 
  we found the Hawaii Pidgin NT both more useful and more user-friendly to use 
  than the SSAs. The two MTTs are not unsophisticated. One has done the full-year 
  SIL courses and is finishing up an MA in linguistics here in Australia, and 
  the other has an MTh and 40 years in ministry and church leadership. Both have 
  superior English, fully capable of using the English translation resources. 
  <i>I would like to see the Hawaii Pidgin NT included in Translator's Workplace</i> 
  so others can use it as they are already using other translations, and a couple 
  back translations that are included in the package.<br>

  ex-pat translators and MTTs being voiced in Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific 
  for over 30 years. Several translation consultants say they have tried to raise 
  this issue, but it has never been politically correct to do so. In practice, 
  there is often a dual standard, if we are honest.<br>
