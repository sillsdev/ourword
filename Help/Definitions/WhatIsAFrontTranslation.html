<p><i>In OurWord we generally refer to the source translation as the Front Translation. 
  Computer adaptation software generally uses the term &quot;source&quot; for 
  this; but we are using &quot;front&quot; in order to make a point about quality. 
  The computer adage &quot;Garbage In Equals Garbage Out&quot; applies to translation: 
  if you start with a poor-quality source translation, then you will be constantly 
  fighting an uphill battle. I have seen first-hand far too many people make excuses 
  for using a poor source translation under the misguided assumption that time 
  will be saved. Sadly, this approach can lead to translations that in terms of 
  exegesis and naturalness, are beyond repair. I would thus strongly suggest that 
  you are far better off drafting from scratch than you are adapting from a poor 
  source translation. </i></p>
<p><i>Following in Charles Grimes' definition of a good-quality front translation.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>Simply put: a <i>Front Translation</i> is source text in a language accessible 
  to local translators. However, when we are honest, many national language translations 
  are inadequate to use as source texts for local translators.</p>
<p>So what we mean by a<i> Front Translation</i> is: A fully consultant checked 
  translation in a regional language of wider communication that is used as an 
  accessible source text for local translators to draft from into their own languages. 
  The Front Translation has:</p>
<ul>
  <li> carefully <b>interpreted</b> the meaning of the original language (Greek 
    or Hebrew) texts (= exegesis)</li>
  <li> carefully worked through, unpacked, and tested <b>key Biblical terms</b>, 
    keeping in mind regionally relevant issues<br>
  </li>
  <li> carefully repackaged the higher level <b>discourse structure</b> so that 
    it uses appropriate patterns for stringing together information widespread 
    in the region for:<br>
    <ul>
      <li> background-foreground information<br>
      </li>
      <li> chronology or logic<br>
      </li>
      <li> referent-tracking mechanisms, such as pronominalisation strategies<br>
      </li>
      <li> shifts in time, location, or action<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> care taken to get the <b>connectors</b> right (accurate and natural conjunctions)<br>
  </li>
  <li> care taken in regionally relevant and anthropologically informed <b>lexical 
    choice</b> issues to make sure the right word is used from a group of similar 
    words<br>
  </li>
  <li> care taken to carefully and appropriately employ <b>idioms</b> and <b>figures 
    of speech</b> widespread in the region<br>
  </li>
  <li> had at least two <b>community checks</b> with groups of uninitiated native 
    speakers of the language of wider communication to ensure clarity and naturalness<br>
  </li>
  <li> addressed <b>implicit to explicit</b> issues in response to uninitiated 
    native speaker answers, and in accord with discourse patterns of languages 
    in the region<br>
  </li>
  <li> where possible and appropriate, the front translation has had the <b>involvement</b> 
    of senior church leaders, and they are on-board with the over-all approach 
    to translation as well as the style<br>
  </li>
</ul>
