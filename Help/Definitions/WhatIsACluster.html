<p><i>A common misconception is that a cluster, at least with regard to the feasibility 
  of Bible translation, must be defined as languages that are linguistically related. 
  With manual adaptation, however, we have found that linguistic similarity is 
  not a crucial factor; in fact languages can be of completely different families, 
  &#151;as long as the translators are bilingual in the source translation. There 
  are numerous other factors, though, which do indeed impact how a cluster is 
  defined and how the work might be carried out to most favorably impact Scripture 
  Use. In the following Dr. Charles E. Grimes describes clusters as seen in Timor, 
  Indonesia.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>I suggest that there are various kinds of &#147;clusters&#148;, and several 
  aspects of &#147;clusters&#148; often converge in a given situation. Each type 
  can be expoited as an opportunity. A &#147;cluster&#148; may be:</p>
<h3>1. Closely related languages.</h3>
<p>In the Timor region, this is of little significance over-all, and of only secondary 
  relevance for 6 translations on the island of Rote. The translators in that 
  dialect-language chain are basically not even interested in what their neighbouring 
  language translations are saying. In fact there are social and cultural reasons 
  that make some of them refuse to even consider how neighbouring languages might 
  phrase something. It is the advisors not the MTT&#146;s who feel it is worth 
  checking how something has been translated in a closely related language.</p>
<h3>2. Geographical proximity.</h3>
<p>E.g. same island, region, province, country. This is logistically relevant 
  for several &#147;clusters&#148; in the Timor region.</p>
<h3>3. Political cohesion.</h3>
<p>E.g. they fall under the same administrative control and share the same political 
  or security considerations. In the Timor context, all the languages in East 
  Timor share certain political considerations, even though they may not be related 
  linguistically. In west Timor Dhao relates politically to Rote, whereas linguistically 
  it is closest to Hawu. However Hawu falls administratively under Kupang. This 
  impacts a number of things in the total picture of doing translation.</p>
<h3>4. Church dominance.</h3>
<p>In the Timor context we relate to 3 different synods in mainline protestant 
  churches, each with different geographical scope. The Catholics have a completely 
  separate hierarchy, and so we also need to relate to several different bishops 
  and archbishops. Some of the bishops relate to each other, and some do not. 
  There is no relationship between the Catholic system and the protestant system. 
  Among the smaller denominations, there are several that are strictly urban and 
  have no vision for nor interest in vernacular translations. Historically, in 
  places like the top end of Australia, Vanuatu and parts of Indonesia, churches 
  or mission societies have actually carved up a map and staked out territories 
  as &#147;belonging&#148; to different churches to missionize. If there is to 
  be any real scripture use of our translations, in those regions we MUST relate 
  to those churches in unique and appropriate ways. GMIT [the largest synod, with 
  1.3 million members] church leaders have specifically requested that vernacular 
  translations of the Bible done in their geographically scattered &#147;region&#148; 
  not diverge greatly from each other in their exegetical choices. This makes 
  using a consultant checked Front Translation that has had the involvement of 
  senior church leaders of good standing a strategic necessity. This mandate from 
  the church is a very real consideration when interacting with translation teams, 
  advisors, and consultants (Many SIL consultants are not used to working within 
  these parameters.)</p>
<h3>5. Organisational dominance.</h3>
<p>In some situations one mission or Bible agency will back off from working in 
  a language or area, because another mission or Bible agency is or has already 
  worked there. In a number of cases this kind of thing can influence where one 
  works, how one translates, and the expectations and translation style of so-called 
  &#145;experienced&#146; local translators and the community. This presents special 
  challenges where the first organisation did not do a good job with such things 
  as usable orthographies, careful exegesis, producing an understandable translation, 
  or relating to churches, but where the church or community is now asking for 
  a usable translation from a different organisation. There are often &quot;clusters&quot; 
  of these languages.</p>
<h3>6. Multilingual situation with a shared language of wider communication.</h3>
<p>This last one is the situation that best characterises what is crucial to what 
  is happening in Timor in Bible translation. It is also a sociolinguistic situation 
  found repeatedly around the world. The fact that speakers of these languages 
  share a language of wider communication is of far greater significance than 
  linguistic relatedness of the vernaculars. It allows us to make a first rate 
  Front Translation in the LWC, and local communities can use it to do an MTT 
  vernacular translation whether they speak Austronesian languages or Papuan languages. 
  It is also what makes the <i>OurWord</i> software so useful in our context&#151;it 
  does not need the languages to work similarly&#151;it only needs the translators 
  to be able to use the Front Translation in the LWC.</p>
